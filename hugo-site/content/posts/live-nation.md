# Live Nation Overview


##### <time datetime="2023-12-08">December 8th, 2023</time>


## **Business Model**


Live Nation is the largest live entertainment company in the world. Live
    Nation’s three main business segments are concerts, ticketing, and
    advertising. Live Nation also has an artist management company with 410
    artists<strong>.</strong>


## **Concerts**:


- Live Nation promotes live music events in venues across the world.

- For a live event, Live Nation as a promoter books the artist and venue. Live Nation markets the concert and sells the tickets.

- Payment for live events: first, the artist receives an advance (guarantee) that they keep regardless of ticket sales. Out of gross ticket sales, the promoter retains all revenue up to their expenses (venue costs, marketing, staff). The remaining net profits typically get divided 85/15 to 90/10 with the artist keeping 85% or 90%. The advance is included in that share. The promoter keeps the 15% or 10% share of net profits, but also eats the losses if gross sales cannot cover expenses and artist's guarantee. A promoter can cancel shows to reduce their losses. Table below illustrates an example of payment distribution:

- Promoters can make rebate deals with venues, in which a venue pays
  the promoter an additional bonus for each ticket sold. For instance,
  if a promoter brings 10 shows to a venue a year, the promoter
  receives a $5/ticket rebate.

- A promoter can purchase an artist’s entire tour and
  cross-collateralize the dates, which allows losses from one concert
  to be recouped from profits from other concerts.

- Live Nation organizes festivals like Lollapalooza.



## **Ticketing**:


- Live Nation owns Ticketmaster, which is a ticketing provider for
  venues. Ticketmaster sold 270 million tickets in 2022. Venues,
  particularly in the US and new venues in Europe, often make an
  exclusive partnership with a ticketing provider.

- Ticket fees include: service fee which is split between the venue
  and Ticketmaster, with the venue usually receiving around 90% of
  that fee; facility fee which is kept by the venue and covers the
  cost of hosting a live event; credit card fee which pays for the
  cost of credit card processing.

- Ticketmaster is in a constant battle against scalpers that buy
  tickets to later resell them on secondary marketplaces. Many artists
  want low ticket prices, but bots resell them later.

- Increased revenue opportunities: Ticketmaster has a dynamic pricing
  algorithm that changes prices based on demand. Ticketmaster sells
  platinum and VIP tickets.

## **Industry Position**


- Live Nation's main competitor within the concerts segment is AEG
  (Anschutz Entertainment Group) which is a private company.

- Within the ticketing segment, Live Nation primarily competes with
  secondary marketplaces like StubHub and SeatGeek, which rely on
  high-volume ticket scalping.



## **Competitive Advantages**


- **Vertical Integration:** Live Nation has a controlling
  interest in 338 venues across 48 countries. Vertical integration
  with venues allows Live Nation to control artist choice with its
  concert business and sell tickets with Ticketmaster, thereby
  avoiding double marginalization. Vertical integration gives Live
  Nation the ability to vertically foreclose access to complementary
  goods which are venues, ticketing, and artists.

- **Ticketing Platform:** Ticketmaster is a highly
  scalable platform that can handle many customers while preventing
  bots from purchasing tickets. Many customers go directly to
  Ticketmaster to buy their tickets, which makes it a marketplace with
  a network effect.

- **Global support:** Live Nation is one of two
  businesses along with AEG that can deliver global tour support. Live
  Nation has offices in 44 countries.
