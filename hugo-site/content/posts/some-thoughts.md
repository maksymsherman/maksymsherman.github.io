# Some Thoughts


##### <time datetime="2023-09-23">September 23th, 2023</time>


1. Delayed gratification is a sign of civilization

2. Existence doesn't require perfection, so imperfection doesn't imply a need
   for non-existence

3. The problem with school is that schoolwork is top of mind

4. It's important to go deep on a topic early in life to understand that most
   opinions in the world are too simplistic

5. The world can only be grasped by action, not by contemplation

6. (I don't take enough action)

7. Counterfactuals are hard to think about. It's essential to think about
   counterfactuals

8. Key to understanding people is getting to see them in various contexts

9. If you think you're good at something—you're bad at it. The better we know
   something, the more we realize how far away we are from knowing it well

10. No one should use "former" and "latter" in the same sentence. "First" and
   "second" is more intuitive

11. Maybe we don't have much innovation because we have too much
   communication. Innovation requires going against what others think is
   possible

12. People have a persisting tendency to rise (or fall) to what's expected of
   them

13. Every sufficiently advanced creation gets used for war

14. Not everything is Pareto improving and that's fine

15. Chinese medicine is healthcare, Western medicine is sickcare

16. Loneliness is felt around others; solitude is felt around yourself

17. Evolution by natural selection can only make statements about the past

18. Differentiating exceptional from great is more important than
   differentiating great from good

19. Life is a series of competing objectives. Defining the objectives is
   harder than playing the game of life

20. Most businesses should not be run unless the owner has a condition that
   prevents them from not running it

21. Housing as an investment is incompatible with housing as a right

22. Not thinking in accordance with the times is a sign of independent
   thinking

23. Time horizons are positively correlated with positive-sum behavior
