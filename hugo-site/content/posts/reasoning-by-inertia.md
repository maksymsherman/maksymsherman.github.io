# Reasoning by Inertia


##### <time datetime="2024-02-03">February 3rd, 2024</time>


Two main types of reasoning are reasoning by analogy and reasoning from
  first-principles.


Reasoning by analogy involves thinking about prior experiences that resemble
  your current situation and continuing with the same action as in that analogy.
  Reasoning from first-principles involves analyzing fundamentals about the
  current situation and constructing reasoning from that. But that distinction
  is incomplete.


We easily fool ourselves that we are reasoning by analogy when we are actually
  reasoning by inertia. For reasoning by analogy to be valid, your current
  situation needs to resemble the situation where the analogy originated. If
  your current situation does not resemble the original situation—you are
  reasoning by inertia.


“Reasoning by inertia” is actually an oxymoron. Making decisions through
  inertia, or continuing with past actions, does not constitute reasoning. You
  simply continue with what has been done before without thinking about your
  action. But reasoning is still implied. You evaluated the situation and
  *decided* that inertia was the best course of action. You had the
  agency to reason by analogy or first-principles. Despite being an oxymoron,
  the concept of “reasoning by inertia” is useful in showing the limits of
  analogies.


## Static vs. Dynamic World


The distinction between a static and dynamic world is useful for understanding
  when your default reasoning is reasoning by analogy or inertia.


A static world does not experience change. People use analogies based on the
  past, and the past is the same as the present. Reasoning by analogy dominates
  over reasoning by inertia as nothing changed to make the analogies invalid.


A dynamic world experiences change. People use analogies based on the past,
  but the past is different from the present. Reasoning by inertia dominates
  over reasoning by analogy as changes in the world invalidate analogies.


The more your world or environment changes, the more skeptical you should be
  of analogies.


## Examples


Let’s look at two extreme examples:


1. You are a professor who teaches two sections of the same class
   back-to-back. Any reasoning you deduce from the first class—like what’s
   the best way to present a certain finding—applies to the second class
   because you are operating in a similar environment. Reasoning by analogy
   is valid.
2. If you are thinking about how to educate your children in the 21st
   century, looking back at how our ancestors educated their children 15,000
   years ago is not a great analogy. Compared to the past, we now have more
   technology that allows a small part of the population to produce enough
   food for all of humanity. Your child does not *need* to learn
   hunting. Instead, considering how to prepare your child for a
   service-oriented or a manufacturing-oriented economy is more appropriate.
   Reasoning by analogy is invalid. If we based our education system on how
   our ancestors educated their children 15,000 years ago despite all the
   change in the world—we’d be reasoning by inertia.


The two examples above are extreme. Thinking an analogy between two
  back-to-back classes does not apply or an analogy between education 15,000
  years ago and today applies is absurd. Examples in between those two extremes
  are where we should be more cautious.

Let’s consider the banking system. The US experienced a risk of bank runs in
  the 2008 financial crisis. The policy of deposit insurance up to a certain
  amount and central bank and legislative intervention prevented the panic from
  spreading across the country. Government policies prevented bank failures or
  at least minimized them, so central bank policies stay the same, as they
  worked in the past. Now it’s 2023 and the Silicon Valley Bank is experiencing
  a bank run. The combination of the rise of online banking, social media, and
  the concentration of your clients in group chats made the bank run contagion
  spread much quicker than in 2008. An appropriate central bank risk calculation
  would account for all of those factors, especially the ease of transferring
  money with online banking and the speed with which panic spreads on social
  media. Banking regulators reasoned by inertia. Their monitoring and response
  policies were based on a world where bank runs happened slower than today,
  making the analogy with past bank runs less valid.


Reasoning by inertia is so dangerous precisely because you don’t think you’re
  reasoning at all. You simply continue with something that worked in the past.

In discussing David Deutsch’s The Beginning of Infinity,
  [Brett Hall](https://twitter.com/ToKTeacher) makes a good example
  of reasoning by inertia from the domain of biology:


> Evolution by natural selection being a good explanation in biology doesn’t
> mean it can be extrapolated into domains outside of biology. Marx thought it
> was but that’s incorrect. And the reason it’s incorrect is because the unit
> of selection is a gene which he never knew anyway. But moreover, as David
> has said, it’s just a metaphor. He was using a metaphor and taking himself
> too seriously comparing evolution of biological organisms to a way in which
> a state is going to evolve over time, change over time. Change going on in a
> natural world, and therefore change going on in society. So they will be
> explanatory in a different area. Worse of all, he was going to use it to
> predict things. We cannot predict what the organisms are going to evolve

Marx extrapolating evolution by natural selection into the domain of
  governments is an example of reasoning by inertia. If something is valid in
  biology—assume it is valid in other domains. But the analogy was incorrect
  because governments are fundamentally different from biology, and trying to
  analogize them is an argument by inertia.

We can think of the life of institutions as reasoning by first-principles at
  birth, reasoning by analogy most of the time, and reasoning by inertia at
  their demise. For some time since founding, the environment is similar to the
  time at founding and reasoning by analogy is still valid. As the world changes
  with time, reasoning by analogy becomes reasoning by inertia, so the
  institution automatically declines in that changing world.

In the domain of advice,
  [Jeremy Giffon](https://twitter.com/jeremygiffon/status/1678874025395916800)
  believes:


> There is no such thing as general advice. Asking someone for it is simply
> asking them to make up a general rule based on their own specific
> experience. Instead, ask people what they did and why and decide whether and
> how it applies to your life, yourself.


General advice is a wishful belief in the broad applicability of reasoning by
  analogy. The correct reasoning by analogy involves an understanding of how
  much someone’s reasoning applies to your life. Otherwise, you’re reasoning by
  inertia.

Analogies are especially dangerous when you have a high variance outcome.

All rules—outside of the domains of hard sciences—have exceptions (and saying
  that rules in the domain of hard sciences don’t have exceptions is an
  exception to the rule that all rules have exceptions). When you have high
  variance outcomes like venture capitalists whose returns are driven by the
  power law, missing out on one opportunity can be the difference between an
  exceptional and a mediocre career. Relying on analogies in such domains has a
  large downside potential.


High variance domains require a rejection of analogies because outcomes are
  driven by a small number of cases, and analogies make it easy to overlook an
  opportunity. Exceptional opportunities today rarely resemble exceptional
  opportunities of the past.

Blockchains negate many analogies. The fundamental facts about blockchains
  differ from systems of the past. Blockchains create a
  cryptographically-enforced global consensus and their fundamental unit is an
  account, not a person. These properties have not existed before, so one should
  reason about blockchains from first-principles, not an analogy-disguised
  inertia.

Reasoning by inertia is wrong because it gives the inaccurate perception of
  reasoning. Either accept that you are making a decision based on inertia, or
  reason using an appropriate analogy or from first-principles. Don’t fool
  yourself.
