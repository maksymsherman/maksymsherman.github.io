  <li><p>Delayed gratification is a sign of civilization</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence doesn't require perfection, so imperfection doesn't imply a need
      for non-existence
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>The problem with school is that schoolwork is top of mind</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It’s important to go deep on a topic early in life to understand that most
      opinions in the world are too simplistic
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>The world can only be grasped by action, not by contemplation</p></li>
  <li><p>(I don't take enough action)</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Counterfactuals are hard to think about. It's essential to think about
      counterfactuals
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Key to understanding people is getting to see them in various contexts
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you think you’re good at something—you’re bad at it. The better we know
      something, the more we realize how far away we are from knowing it well
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      No one should use "former" and "latter" in the same sentence. "First" and
      "second" is more intuitive
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Maybe we don’t have much innovation because we have too much
      communication. Innovation requires going against what others think is
      possible
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      People have a persisting tendency to rise (or fall) to what’s expected of
      them
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Every sufficiently advanced creation gets used for war</p></li>
  <li><p>Not everything is Pareto improving and that’s fine</p></li>
  <li><p>Chinese medicine is healthcare, Western medicine is sickcare</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>Loneliness is felt around others; solitude is felt around yourself</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Evolution by natural selection can only make statements about the past
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Differentiating exceptional from great is more important than
      differentiating great from good
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Life is a series of competing objectives. Defining the objectives is
      harder than playing the game of life
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Most businesses should not be run unless the owner has a condition that
      prevents them from not running it
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Housing as an investment is incompatible with housing as a right</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Not thinking in accordance with the times is a sign of independent
      thinking
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time horizons are positively correlated with positive-sum behavior</p>
  </li>
