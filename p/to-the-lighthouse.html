<h1>To The Lighthouse</h1>
<h5>October 18th, 2021</h5>

<p>
  In <em>To the Lighthouse</em>, Virginia Woolf explores darkness, an elusive
  and mysterious component of every living human being. Oftentimes, the greatest
  joy and revelations come from what is challenging to access. By attempting to
  illuminate and ascribe meaning to darkness, Woolf brings us along for the
  journey of exploring what the meaning of life is and how to make the most out
  of the individual moments that bring us joy.
</p>
<p>
  In Chapter XI of The Window, Mrs. Ramsay thinks about the disappointment James
  will never forget due to not going to the Lighthouse.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    "Although she continued to knit, and sat upright, it was thus that she felt
    herself; and this self having shed its attachments was free for the
    strangers of adventures. When life sank down for a moment, the range of
    experience seemed limitless. And to everybody there was always this sense of
    unlimited resources, she supposed; one after another, she, Lily, Augustus
    Carmichael, must feel, our apparitions, the things you know us by, are
    simply childish. Beneath it is all dark, it is all spreading, it is
    unfathomably deep; but now and again we rise to the surface and that is what
    you see us by. Her horizon seemed to her limitless. There were all the
    places she had not seen; the Indian plains; she felt herself pushing aside
    the thick leather curtain of a church in Rome. This core of darkness could
    go anywhere, for no one saw it. They could not stop it, she thought,
    exulting. There was freedom, there was peace, there was, most welcome of
    all, a summoning together, a resting on a platform of stability. Not as
    oneself did one find rest ever, in her experience (she accomplished here
    something dexterous with her needles) but as a wedge of darkness" (62-63).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The passage evokes a sense of intellectual and emotional clarity. Mrs. Ramsay
  finds peace in not being herself, in seeping away from reality into the
  “wedge-shaped core of darkness” that contains a “platform of stability.” It
  seems that darkness is a desirable place where limits cease to exist, and one
  finds their full potential. The only possible way to be sincere, be who
  someone really is, is to go to the wedge of darkness. It is the place where
  one feels like oneself.
</p>
<p>
  At first, it sounds contradictory that darkness is a place with limitless
  possibilities since one cannot see all of those possibilities in the dark.
  However, the darkness within the passage evokes a thought that light unveils
  all possibilities available to us within our real world. The world seems
  vulnerably naked and without obvious secrets; on the other hand, darkness
  veils what one could see without a source of light in that darkness. When
  something is concealed, the possibilities of what that something is are
  limitless because the limited silhouette is nonexistent. The use of the verb
  “could” in the sentence “this core of darkness could go anywhere” emphasizes
  that Mrs. Ramsay has not fully explored her darkness.
</p>
<p>
  To explore one’s darkness, one needs to go on an individual exploratory
  journey with an open-minded perspective. One needs to access darkness by going
  in the inward direction, by going into a self’s subconsciousness when one
  feels “life [sinking] down for a moment.”
</p>
<p>
  It is then obvious why everyone might want to access that darkness. It is a
  place of “freedom,” of “peace;” it is a “platform of stability,” a description
  eerily similar to how I imagine a Lighthouse in the real world. A Lighthouse
  represents the place of stability that succeeds a long journey on the water;
  it is a light-producing structure that gives clarity and protects sailors from
  running aground while they are disoriented in darkness. Given that the novel
  is named <em>To the Lighthouse</em>, the above passage clarifies that darkness
  will play an essential role in getting to that desirable place, the
  Lighthouse. The meaning of life is to go on that journey.
</p>
<p>
  Humans have a natural longing to understand the purpose of life and what
  fulfilling life entails. When a concept as mysterious as a “wedge of darkness”
  is introduced, it offers a plausible source of explanation that one longs to
  explore. In Chapter III of The Lighthouse, Lily Briscoe provides her answer to
  that all-encompassing question:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    "What is the meaning of life? That was all--a simple question; one that
    tended to close in on one with years. The great revelation had never come.
    The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead there were little daily
    miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark" (161).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Lily believes that the meaning of life does not reveal itself through a great
  revelation that suddenly comes. Instead, the meaning of life is the collection
  of miracles that accumulate over one’s lifetime; the miracles we experience
  are illuminations of our darkness. Miracles are something we see for a moment
  in time, and then they disappear back into the darkness, but they still live
  on in our memory. Hence, darkness encompasses and possibly reveals the meaning
  of life.
</p>
<p>
  Woolf expresses the minutiae of human life, those daily miracles. When one
  thinks of striking matches, it is usually the case that not every attempt will
  lead to a successful fire. Nevertheless, one still tries to strike the match
  until it lights on fire. Throughout the novel, Woolf is constantly trying to
  strike those matches, to illuminate our darkness. However, every strike is
  still merely an attempt at striking a match whose success cannot be predicted
  using scientific tools. One needs to keep trying until a successful match
  strikes, however long-desired and unexpected that strike can be.
</p>
<p>
  Woolf realizes that those moments of darkness one remembers for a long time do
  not just come deliberately. Instead, those moments occur throughout our lives,
  and each one of us experiences them. There are moments when we feel that life
  sinks down for a moment. The reality is that those moments do not occur at a
  predictable time nor with predictable certainty. One should appreciate when
  such moments come.
</p>
<p>In Chapter XI of The Lighthouse, Lily Briscoe ruminates:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    "It was a way things had sometimes, she thought, lingering for a moment and
    looking at the long glittering windows and the plume of blue smoke: they
    became unreal. So coming back from a journey, or after an illness, before
    habits had spun themselves across the surface, one felt that same unreality,
    which was so startling; felt something emerge. Life was most vivid then"
    (192).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The unreality discussed in this passage is the feeling one feels in darkness.
  Those moments of unreality are precisely when those matches successfully
  struck and upset the stillness of darkness. Darkness arises from reality but
  feels unreal. Darkness is unreal, unfathomable. Ironically, life is most vivid
  when it feels unreal, even though life is often the most real it gets in these
  moments. It is a great paradox of reality. Reality that we constantly
  experience imposes constraints upon our lives. Unreality that we rarely
  experience is when life gets most vivid. In a sense, Woolf gives voice to the
  silent space that separates people and shows that this space is where life has
  the most meaning. It is a place where time slows down, and we truly live in a
  moment.
</p>
<p>
  A painting is a way to capture the moment when the match struck. It is a way
  to eternalize that moment in the same way that books eternalize words. A
  painting allows one to reaccess the image concealed by darkness that was
  revealed for a moment and then went dark again. Throughout the book, Lily is
  working on a painting that she does not finish until the end of the novel. The
  painting is a way for Lily to visualize her imagination. Lily has a good
  understanding of how different elements of the painting should interact with
  each other. The following conversation between William Bankes and Lily shows
  that understanding:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    "But William, she remembered, had listened to her with his wise child's eyes
    when she explained how it was not irreverence: how a light there needed a
    shadow there and so on"<strong> (</strong>176).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The passage highlights how light interacts with objects. As the light on the
  painting passes objects, it needs a corresponding shadow. A shadow and the
  slight darkness caused by the shadow endow an object with a sense of reality
  in human eyes. If there is a shadow, then an object must exist. Every element
  of the painting exists in relation to all other elements on the painting.
</p>
<p>At the end of the novel, Lily completed her painting:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    "With a sudden intensity, as if she saw it clear for a second, she drew a
    line there, in the center. It was done; it was finished. Yes, she thought,
    laying down her brush in extreme fatigue, I have had my vision" (209).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The above passage represents the novel’s ending, so it seems significant that
  Lily’s vision is realized by finally finishing her painting with a single line
  in the center. The vision allows Lily to understand her darkness better, to
  capture that miracle that the dark encompasses. It seems that this line
  highlights the ultimate goal of capturing a miracle and saving it in the real
  world. However, based on Lily’s words that “a light there needed a shadow
  there,” even the final line on the painting exists in relation to all other
  elements on the painting. As the line symbolizes how Lily captures a part of
  her darkness, it seems that darkness cannot exist without being in relation to
  other things. Darkness does not exist in a vacuum; those miracles contained in
  the darkness require a degree of otherness to be meaningful. Darkness on its
  own is meaningless; it is the synergy of light and darkness that ascribes
  meaning and value to life.
</p>
<p>
  The synergy of light and darkness fosters the ability to experience joy in
  life. Their co-existence creates frictions that open up a path to joy. When
  light penetrates darkness, the imagery is similar to how two continental
  plates collide and one sinks beneath the other. The plates do not move
  continuously; pressure builds up for years and decades. Then, that pressure
  gets released and causes an earthquake. In the release, the movement of two
  plates relative to each other creates an opening in the moment of movement.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, light does not continuously penetrate darkness; there is a build-up
  that precedes the event. When light enters darkness, an opening is created,
  and the potentials of that opening are limitless. The opening creates a space
  for something memorable, which stays even after the interaction between light
  and darkness concludes. However, to create that memory and ascribe meaning to
  it, an interaction between light and darkness needs to occur. Darkness exists
  within all of us, so it is necessary to have a source of light in one’s life
  to reveal that darkness. The Lighthouse represents one such source of light.
</p>
<p>
  Cam Ramsay, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay, came with her father and James
  for the journey to the Lighthouse. While on the boat, Cam experienced “a sense
  of adventure and escape that she wanted, for she was thinking, as the boat
  sailed on, how her father’s anger about the points of the compass, James’s
  obstinacy about the compact, and her anguish, all had slipped, all had passed,
  all had steamed away (188-189).” In essence, Cam feels a sense of freedom both
  in and from the real world. The scene continues:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    "From her hand, ice cold, held deep in the sea, there spurted up a fountain
    of joy at the change, at the escape, at the adventure (that she should be
    alive, that she should be there). And the drops falling from this sudden and
    unthinkable fountain of joy fell here and there on the dark, the slumbrous
    shapes in her mind; shapes of a world not realised but turning in their
    darkness, catching here and there, a spark of light; Greece, Rome,
    Constantinople" (189).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The passage makes the connection between joy and darkness. Cam is experiencing
  intense joy, and that joy comes from darkness. Joy makes us intelligent. As
  sparks of joy rain into the dark parts of the mind, certain things begin to
  come to mind that did not before. Joy and darkness depend on each other to
  exist and enhance each other in a positive feedback loop. As those shapes
  catch here and there a spark of light, only some of those shapes get
  illuminated at a certain time. The slumbrous shapes responsively shine and
  then go dark again. The use of “Greece, Rome, Constantinople” as examples
  expands the reader’s perspective on the possibilities those slumbrous shapes
  uncover. The passage is one of the moments when the match struck successfully,
  and, in turn, the event expands our perspective and brings us joy.
</p>
<p>
  The moment of joy and expanded perspective is an inherently individual
  phenomenon. One person’s experience cannot be identically experienced by
  another person since all of us are individuals who have unique perspectives on
  the world on which we base our understanding of what we see. Hence, when two
  people see the same event, the understanding and memories of that event of the
  first person differ from the understanding and memories of another person.
</p>
<p>
  Our observations of the world do not represent universal truth as there is no
  single universal truth. Truth comes from an assemblage of many perspectives
  that can change over time. This point is emphasized throughout the dinner
  scene in Chapter XVII of The Window, and especially in its culmination:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    "It could not last, she knew, but at the moment her eyes were so clear that
    they seemed to go round the table unveiling each of these people, and their
    thoughts and their feelings, without effort like a light stealing under
    water so that its ripples and the reeds in it and the minnows balancing
    themselves, and the sudden silent trorut are all lit up hanging, trembling.
    So she saw them; she heard them; but whatever they said had also this
    quality, as if what they said was like the movement of a trout when, at the
    same time, one can see the ripple and the gravel, something to the right,
    something to the left; and the whole is held together" (106-107).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The world is depicted as a collection of many “truths” that seem like truths
  only in the eyes of the beholder. Overall, there is a suspension of truth.
  What one person sees is not the objective reality of what is truly happening.
  Truth is a fluid concept that changes over time. As humans, it is so easy to
  find truth in places where we want to find the truth. Confirmation bias, the
  tendency to search for and interpret information in a way that confirms one’s
  beliefs, is a subconscious feature of most individuals. It is easier to cling
  to what one already knows than to challenge those beliefs, especially when one
  builds their identity on those beliefs. The way one sees the world in a moment
  is a function of one’s preconceived beliefs at that point in time. The
  definition of truth changes with each passing moment. Hence, a single
  perspective does not provide an objective truth of a given situation as that
  perspective suffers from a lack of objectivity.
</p>
<p>
  The experience of the dinner scene begs the question: when light illuminates
  darkness, what does it reveal? What one sees in darkness is still a function
  of one’s beliefs about the world. Darkness is perceived by a single
  individual, and Woolf concedes that a single perspective fails to achieve
  objectivity in a world where individual biases influence the perception of
  one’s surroundings. But if one lacks objectivity to process regular day-to-day
  moments, how could one objectively process what one finds in their darkness?
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps, darkness cannot accommodate more than one perspective. The memories
  one is left with after experiencing an illumination of darkness are deeply
  personal and reflect one’s beliefs about the world. It seems that the
  revelation revealed by the strike of matches that is so desirable suffers from
  a lack of objectivity.
</p>
<p>
  In the end, one is left with the question: when matches strike unexpectedly in
  the dark, is what is revealed by illuminating darkness the best approximation
  of truth one can get?<br />
