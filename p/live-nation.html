<h1>Live Nation Overview</h1>
<h5>December 8th, 2023</h5>

<h2><strong>Business Model</strong></h2>
<p>
    Live Nation is the largest live entertainment company in the world. Live
    Nation’s three main business segments are concerts, ticketing, and
    advertising. Live Nation also has an artist management company with 410
    artists<strong>.</strong>
</p>
<h2><strong>Concerts</strong>:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Live Nation promotes live music events in venues across the world.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            For a live event, Live Nation as a promoter books the artist and venue.
            Live Nation markets the concert and sells the tickets.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Payment for live events: first, the artist receives an advance
            (guarantee) that they keep regardless of ticket sales. Out of gross
            ticket sales, the promoter retains all revenue up to their expenses
            (venue costs, marketing, staff). The remaining net profits typically get
            divided 85/15 to 90/10 with the artist keeping 85% or 90%. The advance
            is included in that share. The promoter keeps the 15% or 10% share of
            net profits, but also eats the losses if gross sales cannot cover
            expenses and artist’s guarantee. A promoter can cancel shows to reduce
            their losses. Table below illustrates an example of payment
            distribution:

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Promoters can make rebate deals with venues, in which a venue pays
                    the promoter an additional bonus for each ticket sold. For instance,
                    if a promoter brings 10 shows to a venue a year, the promoter
                    receives a $5/ticket rebate.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A promoter can purchase an artist’s entire tour and
                    cross-collateralize the dates, which allows losses from one concert
                    to be recouped from profits from other concerts.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Live Nation organizes festivals like Lollapalooza.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Ticketing</strong>:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Live Nation owns Ticketmaster, which is a ticketing provider for
                    venues. Ticketmaster sold 270 million tickets in 2022. Venues,
                    particularly in the US and new venues in Europe, often make an
                    exclusive partnership with a ticketing provider.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Ticket fees include: service fee which is split between the venue
                    and Ticketmaster, with the venue usually receiving around 90% of
                    that fee; facility fee which is kept by the venue and covers the
                    cost of hosting a live event; credit card fee which pays for the
                    cost of credit card processing.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Ticketmaster is in a constant battle against scalpers that buy
                    tickets to later resell them on secondary marketplaces. Many artists
                    want low ticket prices, but bots resell them later.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Increased revenue opportunities: Ticketmaster has a dynamic pricing
                    algorithm that changes prices based on demand. Ticketmaster sells
                    platinum and VIP tickets.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Sponsorship &amp; Advertising</strong>:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Sponsors advertise using Live Nation’s concert, festival, venue and
                    ticketing assets.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Economics</strong></h2>

                    Note: AOI is a non-GAAP measure which measures operating income (loss) before non-operational factors.

        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Operating income largely comes from ticketing and sponsorship &amp;
                    advertising.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Industry Position</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Live Nation's main competitor within the concerts segment is AEG
                    (Anschutz Entertainment Group) which is a private company.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Within the ticketing segment, Live Nation primarily competes with
                    secondary marketplaces like StubHub and SeatGeek, which rely on
                    high-volume ticket scalping.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Competitive Advantages</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Vertical Integration:</strong> Live Nation has a controlling
                    interest in 338 venues across 48 countries. Vertical integration
                    with venues allows Live Nation to control artist choice with its
                    concert business and sell tickets with Ticketmaster, thereby
                    avoiding double marginalization. Vertical integration gives Live
                    Nation the ability to vertically foreclose access to complementary
                    goods which are venues, ticketing, and artists.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ticketing Platform:</strong> Ticketmaster is a highly
                    scalable platform that can handle many customers while preventing
                    bots from purchasing tickets. Many customers go directly to
                    Ticketmaster to buy their tickets, which makes it a marketplace with
                    a network effect.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Global support:</strong> Live Nation is one of two
                    businesses along with AEG that can deliver global tour support. Live
                    Nation has offices in 44 countries.
