<h1>Beyond Blockchain Marketplaces</h1>
<h5>August 27th, 2022</h5>

<p>
  Marketplaces are places where people gather to trade. In ancient times,
  marketplaces were physical locations where traders met to exchange valuable
  goods like silk or tea. In recent times, many marketplaces are online
  marketplaces like Amazon or App Store. As marketplaces have existed for a long
  time, it might seem logical that they should exist in Web3.
</p>
<p>So why should marketplaces exist in Web3?</p>
<p>
  Let’s explore what a marketplace means as a concept. Market refers to all
  buyers and sellers of a good or service considered together. Place means a
  physical or virtual place where buyers and sellers meet. The concept of place
  implies uniqueness as there is a specific place where the trade takes place.
  Traditionally, once a buyer or seller comes to a place, they can’t
  simultaneously appear at a different place.
</p>
<p>
  But Web3 marketplaces are not unique. Users can exchange NFTs through OpenSea,
  but NFTs are stored as code on a blockchain, not OpenSea’s database. The
  actual exchange place is the blockchain, a backend shared by all marketplaces.
  So OpenSea, a centralized marketplace, extracts a tax in the form of
  transaction fees from a fundamentally open-source transaction.
</p>
<p>Many attempts to build a dominant blockchain marketplace include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Lowering marketplace fees compared to incumbents but keeping them greater
      than 0%
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A native token that accrues value through a claim on marketplace fees</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>However, both approaches are fundamentally misguided.</p>
<p>
  A reduction of marketplace fees merely represents an incremental improvement
  for users compared to Web2. As blockchains have no data lock-in, users will
  continuously flock to marketplaces with the lowest fees. The lowest possible
  fee is zero percent, representing a fundamental improvement in user experience
  over Web2 and providing a defensible, albeit non-extractive, marketplace
  position.
</p>
<p>
  Native marketplace tokens provide users with ownership. And the argument goes
  – once users are owners, they become loyal and incentive-aligned marketplace
  participants who advocate for widespread network adoption. The problem is that
  rebates to tokens encourage wash trading and displace a marketplace’s
  potential product-market fit. When crypto prices decline, incumbent
  marketplaces with non-zero take rates and a preset maximum token supply have
  trouble bootstrapping the lost volume. Insurgent marketplaces with
  newly-issued tokens have a great shot at enticing user participation and
  ultimately unseating the incumbent’s network effects.
</p>
<h3>The Opportunity for Open Blockchain Marketplaces</h3>
<p>
  Currently, every marketplace needs to build a unique backend for its needs in
  the form of smart contracts. Such a backend should be universally shared, as
  centralized liquidity makes for the best user experience.
</p>
<p>Open blockchain marketplaces require:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>A data standard</p></li>
  <li><p>An immutable marketplace-like structure</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
  Data standards create user trust and simplify the workings of a marketplace.
</p>
<p>
  Immutable structures allow for
  <a

    >composability</a
  >, meaning anyone can leverage a permissionless building block to build more
  complex offerings upstream.
</p>
<p>
  As the first example of open blockchain marketplaces, let’s consider NFTs.
  Open-source data standards already exist –
  <a href="https://docs.metaplex.com/?ref=maksymsherman.com">Metaplex</a> for
  Solana and
  <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721?ref=maksymsherman.com"
    >ERC-721</a
  >
  for Ethereum. But an immutable, widely-adopted marketplace-like structure for
  trading NFTs does not yet exist. OpenSea can arbitrarily ban individual NFTs
  and users from transacting on its website. On Ethereum,
  <a href="https://zdk.zora.co/?ref=maksymsherman.com">Zora</a> is building an
  immutable
  <a href="https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html?ref=maksymsherman.com"
    >hyperstructure</a
  >
  for NFTs, and
  <a href="https://sudoswap.xyz/?ref=maksymsherman.com#/">SudoSwap</a> is a
  decentralized, royalty-free NFT marketplace on Ethereum that is
  <a href="https://dune.com/0xRob/sudoamm?ref=maksymsherman.com"
    >gaining traction</a
  >. On Solana, Metaplex's
  <a
    href="https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/auction-house/?ref=maksymsherman.com"
    >Auction House</a
  >
  protocol permits decentralized sales for NFTs, although most of Solana’s NFT
  <a
    href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-metaplex-q2-2022?ref=maksymsherman.com"
    >volume flows through Magic Eden</a
  >, a closed marketplace.
</p>
<p>
  An open blockchain marketplace for NFTs would create a non-extractive and
  permissionless global liquidity pool that any marketplace can leverage. An
  immutable structure cannot turn its back on developers and extract value like
  Web2 companies. It can only cooperate and act as a building block for future
  development.
</p>
<p>
  As a second example of open blockchain marketplaces, let’s consider freelance
  marketplaces. An on-chain data standard for freelance portfolios does not yet
  exist. Braintrust, the most popular crypto-native freelance marketplace, locks
  freelancers and employers into its platform by storing their data on a closed
  backend. So it is practically impossible to create a marketplace-like
  structure as there is no standard on which to transact. Hence, an open
  blockchain freelance marketplace requires on-chain credentialing, a
  non-trivial but solvable problem that suffers from the
  <a
    href="https://li.substack.com/p/the-standards-innovation-paradox?ref=maksymsherman.com"
    >Standards Innovation Paradox</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Once on-chain credentialing is solved, a potential issue arises in the case of
  disputes between freelancers and companies. For instance, a company might
  claim that a freelancer’s work was not done to a stipulated standard. Dispute
  resolution requires intermediaries. So arbitration services (centralized or
  decentralized) will still exist. If an arbitration service behaves
  suboptimally – marketplace users will switch to a different arbitrator as all
  data is composable. A credibly neutral marketplace-like protocol would
  supercharge the freelancing industry.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  Web2-like marketplaces are centralized and closed, while blockchains are
  decentralized and open. The extractive marketplace model is a skeuomorphic
  inheritance of Web2 that won’t survive given credible commitments and
  composability possible in blockchain systems.
</p>
<p>
  Marketplaces are fundamentally about connecting buyers and sellers. Extractive
  marketplaces can’t endure in systems where assets are stored on open backends.
</p>
<p>
  If an open backend standard doesn’t yet exist for a particular good or
  service, someone will create that standard, and a credibly neutral and
  non-extractive marketplace-like structure will commence.
