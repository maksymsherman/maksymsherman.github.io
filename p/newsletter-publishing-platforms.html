<h1>The Future of Substack and Newsletter Publishing Platforms</h1>

<h2><strong>Product-Market Definition</strong></h2>
<p>
  Our market of interest is email-based newsletter publishing platforms,
  specifically English-language content for U.S.-based readers and content
  creators. These platforms distribute written content to a list of
  voluntary—sometimes paid—subscribers via email, and are distinctive as a
  bundle of services. The core of this bundle are email distribution, listserv
  management, newsletter construction and formatting tools, website hosting, and
  payment processing; differentiations of this product could include promotional
  services, analytics, or an advertiser marketplace. These services take
  advantage of specialization, outsourcing these settings to platforms with more
  experience doing so as opposed to the writers with less technical experience
  and interest.
</p>
<p>
  There are other services that are on the border of this product-market. For
  example, blogs can publish on WordPress and Medium, which are primarily web
  hosting services. While these services also allow writers to collect paying
  subscribers and send emails, their offerings are not optimized for newsletter
  creation and distribution, which leads to a somewhat different creator base
  who depend more on search engine optimization and advertising revenue.
  Meanwhile, many larger news and publishing organizations, or content creators,
  are vertically integrated with respect to newsletter publishing:
  <em>Morning Brew</em> and <em>Bloomberg</em>, for example, offer email
  newsletters, and manage listservs, email distribution, and payments in-house.
</p>
<h2><strong>Thesis</strong></h2>
<p>
  Newsletter platforms have disintermediated traditional media such as
  newspapers, allowing content creators to connect directly to their readers
  through email delivery and readers to create an a la carte selection of
  writing to read as opposed to a bundled newspaper publication. In recent
  years, newsletter platforms have grown in popularity, attracting well-regarded
  writers from newspapers, fueled by an expanding market of readers who are
  moving away from traditional written media. Platforms’ recommendation features
  have also fueled newsletter subscription growth. Currently, in the industry’s
  early stage, readers still add newsletters as opposed to replacing them. To
  writers, recommendations feature on platforms like Substack creates
  complementarity with other newsletters: more newsletters on the platform
  increases the number of newsletters recommending yours; combined with a
  growing platform readership, this will grow your subscribers.
</p>
<p>
  However, the number of writers will grow over time: the rise of AI-assisted
  writing lowers the cost of producing an argument and synthesizing information,
  and will lower the barrier to entry for newsletter writers, while existing
  writers on other mediums will migrate to newsletters. As the number of
  newsletters increases, readers will near their reading capacity and the
  newsletter market will begin to saturate. To readers, newsletters will become
  increasingly substitutable: most new subscriptions will have to replace an old
  one, especially if those subscriptions are paid.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  This substitutability will reduce the upside of the recommendation feature to
  large creators, as benefits of subscriber growth through Substack’s network
  will not cover Substack’s higher price compared to other platforms. Because
  all large platforms have exportable email lists and creator-owned Stripe
  accounts for paid subscriptions, which allow hassle-free platform migration,
  large creators will migrate off of Substack. Meanwhile, Substack will use its
  network to service smaller, newer creators seeking a platform to act as an
  incubator and help them to ‘break out’ and ‘graduate’ from Substack once their
  subscriber base becomes stable. Thus, the market for newsletter platforms for
  mature creators will be monopolistically competitive, earning zero long-run
  economic profits, while Substack will earn positive profits as an incubator.
</p>
<h2><strong>Industry Overview</strong></h2>
<p>
  Newsletters disintermediate writers from publishers and allow readers to
  create their own bundles of written content. Throughout the 20th century and
  early 21st century, most of the written content was published by newspapers,
  which distributed writers’ content to readers as a bundle. Newspapers are
  vertically integrated with ‘upstream’ content creators, where readers are
  ‘downstream’. Directly connecting to readers was expensive as delivery could
  not take advantage of the ease of email and online subscription, and bundling
  content meant that readers could pay for one newspaper and get all of the
  written content they wanted to read; however, readers with specific
  preferences had to pay for the whole bundle. From an operational standpoint,
  newspapers have historically earned revenue through subscriptions and
  advertising.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The email newsletter publishing platform industry evolved from blog publishing
  platforms in the early 2010s. At the time, most writers were either employed
  on salary by larger publications, and thus had limited economic upside in
  their work, or were independently publishing through blogs. However, the
  success of these blogs was limited by their less sticky readers, and relied on
  relationships with advertisers for revenue. Newsletters allowed writers to
  bypass these issues by sending written content directly to reader email
  inboxes instead of having readers actively seek out a blog’s website, and
  using subscriptions for revenue to increase reader stickiness—only readers who
  valued the writing highly would pay for it. Writing newsletters therefore
  became an attractive option for writers to own their upside because of
  distribution permitted by newsletter publishing platforms.
</p>
<p>
  Newsletter publishing platforms thus emerged as a way to reduce costs for
  writers, the platforms’ consumers, providing a bundle of necessary services
  for writers: email publishing, listserv management, payment processing,
  website hosting, and newsletter layout. Platforms also include various
  additional features as a means of differentiation, such as advertising
  support, analytics, and, recommendations and network elements. In particular,
  recommendations features, which allow the platform or newsletters to recommend
  other newsletters to their subscribers, have become increasingly important in
  the industry and are the defining feature of its leading player,
  Substack.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  It is important to note that not all newsletter publishing services are
  independent, and there are substitutes for these services. For example, many
  large publications which already have payments and email distribution systems
  do not outsource newsletter distribution to these platforms instead using
  their own systems; the same is true for very large newsletters businesses such
  as <em>Morning Brew</em>. This offers one possible substitute for newsletter
  platforms: purchasing all of the individual services bundled by the platforms
  and distributing emails in-house. Meanwhile, as mentioned, blogs and writing
  for a publication are also alternatives to email newsletter publishing for
  newsletter writers; others, such as podcasts, are both substitutes and
  complements to newsletters (a writer could run a podcast show instead of
  writing, or provide both to their subscribers). While these substitutes are
  relevant to determining demand in our market of interest, they are still
  adjacent markets.
</p>
<p>
  Ghost, the first independent newsletter publishing service, was founded in
  2013 as an open-source nonprofit platform. Ghost currently has 19,735 writers
  on its platform, earning an average annual revenue of $310 per writer. It
  offers four versions of its publishing service—starter, creator, team, and
  business—which are priced at a fixed annual or monthly fee for writers based
  on their number of readers and have increasing capabilities with each tier. As
  Ghost’s price to writers increases with the number of subscribers, though at a
  decreasing rate, it is effectively a variable cost to writers; the different
  versions of Ghost are a form of price discrimination. Ghost also has no
  network effect: there is no specific way for subscribers to one Ghost
  newsletter to find other newsletters that use Ghost. Moreover, because Ghost
  is open-source, writers can self-host Ghost’s software on another service,
  such as Digital Ocean, instead of paying Ghost for its newsletter publishing.
  However, this activity would be considered outside of our product-market, as
  writers, in this case, are vertically integrating with their publishing
  service by self-hosting Ghost’s bundle of services.
</p>
<p>
  Beehiiv, another newsletter platform, was founded in 2021 by former employees
  of <em>Morning Brew</em>, a business newsletter. The platform offers similar
  features to Ghost. Like Ghost, it charges writers based on a monthly fee and
  offers three product versions with various levels of customization and
  analytics tools, called Launch, Grow, and Scale. Two features differentiate
  Beehiiv from Ghost: first, having already cultivated relationships with
  advertisers, Beehiiv offers an advertising marketplace for writers, allow
  writers to more easily place ads in their newsletters and earn
  non-subscription-fee revenue. Second, Beehiiv has a network element, allowing
  writers to recommend other Beehiiv newsletters to subscribers. For example,
  Beehiiv offers a service, Boost, which acts as a paid referral process for
  writers: writers who recommend a newsletter are paid for every one of their
  subscribers that also signs up for the recommended newsletter. However,
  Beehiiv does not have a central website where readers can view all Beehiiv
  newsletters, making it harder for new Beehiiv writers to take advantage of the
  reader network. In terms of pricing, the Launch service is available to
  writers until they reach 2,500 subscribers and Grow until 10,000. Notably,
  Launch does not allow creators to charge users for subscribing or generate
  advertising revenue through Beehiiv’s ad network. Launch is free to writers,
  while Grow costs $42/month and Scale $84/month billed annually, regardless of
  number of subscribers, such that Beehiiv’s service is effectively a flat,
  fixed cost for writers.
</p>
<p>
  Of the major newsletter platforms, Substack is both the largest and most
  distinct, founded in 2017. Unlike the other major platforms, Substack does not
  directly charge a fee to writers, instead taking 10% of writers’ subscription
  revenues. While Substack charges a fee only on paying subscribers, Ghost and
  Beehiiv charge creators for the total number of subscribers. On one hand,
  Beehiiv’s cost to creators is essentially flat with respect to number of
  subscribers, and Ghost charges higher prices with more subscribers at a
  decreasing rate. On the other, Substack’s is linear and thus more expensive
  than the other two, though this pricing concerns only the number of paying
  subscribers. In the chart describing profits by platform (Appendix A), one can
  see how, as the number of subscribers increases, a newsletter’s profitability
  is increasingly lower for a writer on Substack compared to the alternatives—a
  writer with 200,000 subscribers would earn $233,000 less on Substack than on
  Ghost every year. This is also highly sensitive to the percentage of
  subscribers paying for the newsletter: for newsletters with more paying
  subscribers, Substack must provide much more value through its unique network
  in order to justify the cost. As a result of these differences, Beehiiv’s
  pricing model most favors newsletters with more subscribers (paying or
  otherwise), while Substack’s is more favorable to writers with fewer
  <em>paying</em> subscribers, which would presumably imply fewer subscribers
  overall. Pricing thus introduces a key tension between large and small
  creators, based on the number of subscribers.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to its unique pricing model, Substack also differentiates itself
  through a more robust network, through recommendations and its website.
  Recommendations can be thought of as a search device. Many Substack readers
  are introduced to the platform by signing up for a particular newsletter, and
  would not otherwise explore the newsletters on Substack. The recommendations
  feature, which asks users to subscribe to similar newsletters while they sign
  up for the first, facilitates this exploration to the wider Substack network.
  In this sense, creators are complements—subscription to one creator is
  associated with a subscription to another creator. Readers do not know what
  they want to read and the recommendations feature helps them figure this out.
  An important feature is that the default recommendation feature is
  writer-controlled: when a reader subscribes to a creator, the creator chooses
  what other newsletters to recommend. A reader will not get recommendations
  outside of what at least one of the creators they are subscribed to
  recommends.
</p>
<p>
  Substack’s recommendation feature is similar to Beehiiv’s, but is more
  powerful because Substack, as a first mover in network-based newsletter
  platforms, has invested more in acquiring creators and readers. Substack's
  recommendation feature drives 40% of subscriptions and 20% of paid
  subscriptions on its platform. This is aided by Substack saving user
  information in one account, which allows readers to more seamlessly subscribe
  to other newsletters once they have subscribed to one. On Ghost and Beehiiv,
  meanwhile, subscribers must re-enter their information every time they wish to
  subscribe to, and pay for, a newsletter, which adds an element of friction to
  the network. Thus, in addition to the bundled services provided by each of
  these platforms, writers gain the additional benefit of subscription growth
  through the recommendations feature, helping to justify the higher price of
  Substack to creators with larger newsletters.
</p>
<p>
  To build a network of readers and writers, Substack began by attracting
  writers with large and established followings to the platform, providing them
  advances on revenue, with the purpose of drawing in readers. Substack readers
  would then become part of Substack’s network, making Substack attractive to
  writers who could rely on the network to drive subscriptions through
  recommendations or the exploration page. Substack’s network creates an entry
  barrier for other newsletter services using a network-based strategy.
  According to Stigler, a barrier to entry is a cost of producing (at some or
  every rate of output) that must be borne by firms seeking to enter an industry
  but is not borne by firms already in the industry. The entry barriers to the
  core services in this industry are somewhat low, but they have nonetheless
  deterred a flood of entrants into the market. For platforms less focused on
  cultivating a network, there are also entry barriers in the sunk costs of
  product development, namely incumbents’ sunk investments in creating numerous
  features for writers that potential entrants have not sunk, such as added
  customizability and analytics tools. For those platforms seeking to build a
  network through recommendations, entry barriers are higher: the size of both
  the reader and writer network can serve as an entry barrier, as incumbents
  with a large network have already sunk the costs of creating and maintaining
  its relationships to creators and subscribers, which potential entrants could
  not easily replicate without incurring significant fixed costs. AI-assisted
  code writing tools like Github Copilot lower those barriers by decreasing the
  cost of producing code. As a result of these entry barriers, the market for
  newsletter publishing services is an oligopoly, with product differentiation
  through network size and features offered to writers.
</p>
<p>
  These entry barriers are exemplified by two big-tech names which briefly
  entered the newsletter platform space: Twitter and Facebook. Revue, a Dutch
  newsletter platform, was acquired by Twitter in January 2021. Revue was known
  to provide a more simplified service, with fewer customization options, a
  trimmer web hosting service, and fewer promotional and analytics services than
  Substack; this was reflected by Revue’s pricing, a 5% cut of subscription
  revenues compared to Substack’s 10%. Initially, Twitter lightly integrated
  Revue into its social media platform, allowing Twitter users to explore
  newsletters on Revue through a separate tab and to subscribe to Tweeters’
  newsletters directly on Twitter, providing some of the promotional features
  Revue previously lacked. Twitter’s entry into this market, however, was
  unsuccessful: less than two years after the acquisition, Twitter shut down
  Revue. Facebook had a similar experience as a newsletter platform: in June
  2021, it launched newsletter platform Bulletin. Mirroring Substack’s launch,
  Facebook recruited a group of independent writers on various topics to migrate
  to their platform; Facebook did not charge these writers for the use of their
  service. However, unlike the other platforms, Facebook also restricted the set
  of writers, requiring an invitation to write over Bulletin. Like Revue,
  Bulletin shut down in October 2022, ending big tech’s foray into
  newsletters.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  These two entry failures exemplify the presence of entry barriers in the
  newsletter publishing platform market. On Twitter’s part, many well-known
  writers are also prolific Tweeters, but Twitter was unable to successfully
  attract these writers, already on its platform, to its easily-accessible
  newsletter service. In the case of Tweeters who already had newsletters,
  migration was seamless, and Revue’s 5% cut of subscription revenue was lower
  than Substack’s 10% cut. In spite of these advantages, Revue’s simpler
  features indicate that sinking investment costs in features for writers
  creates a significant entry barrier. In the case of Tweeters who did not
  already have a newsletter, the same issue of features would apply, but the
  issue of network quality is also at hand—Substack could attract new writers
  with its existing readers through the recommendations feature. While Twitter
  was able to suggest newsletters to a writer’s Twitter followers, conversion
  was weak, suggesting that Twitter’s readers had different preferences than
  newsletter readers. Intuitively, written content of 140 characters should
  attract consumers with preferences that differ from consumers who read
  long-form newsletters. Thus, having a ‘network’ was not sufficient to bring
  writers in—it had to be a network of newsletter readers. The case of Facebook
  speaks to another key entry barrier: attracting writers. Facebook initially
  tried to build Bulletin by paying over 100 writers to produce content for the
  platform. The failure to execute this plan suggests that either Facebook’s
  user network had different preferences than a newsletter platform’s readers,
  as with Twitter, or that the writers were not able to bring readers in. This
  seems especially prescient because while Facebook attracted writers with
  experience and expertise, they did not attract writers who necessarily had
  followings, which is necessary to build the reader network. These two cases
  substantiate the presence of entry barriers of sunk product development costs
  and attracting the appropriate readers and writers to a platform’s network.
</p>
<h2><strong>Networks &amp; Two-Sided Markets</strong></h2>
<p>
  Substack’s main differentiation from other newsletter publishing services is
  its network. Services like Ghost and Beehiiv offer publishing services as
  production inputs for writers, who use the platforms to distribute their
  content to end users, or readers. Beehiiv has some network elements, such as a
  recommendation feature when you sign up for a newsletter, but are largely
  distribution services that connect individual readers to individual creators,
  rather than connecting its set of creators to its set of readers. In this
  respect, these publishing services are essentially an upstream input for
  creators.
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand, Substack operates as a platform that connects its creators
  to its readers. On Substack’s website, readers can ‘shop’ for different
  newsletters based on their interests, while its recommendations feature
  creates complementary effects between creators through sharing readers. Unlike
  other publishing services, where writers acquire readers individually and use
  that revenue to pay the publishing service, many writers on Substack rely on
  Substack’s reader network to grow. Similarly, some Substack readers are on the
  platform to find new writers. Thus, Substack’s platform has elements of a
  two-sided market. Substack’s pricing model charges only writers, with readers’
  access to Substack ‘subsidized’ by the take rate from writers, who in turn
  fund this through subscription fees from readers. As a result of their
  network-based model, Substack is reliant on cultivating a reader base; a
  reader base is what increases writers’ demand for Substack’s network. On the
  other side of the market, Substack’s ability to generate profits depends on
  their ability to attract writers with paying subscribers, meaning that
  Substack is incentivized to promote the entry of writers whose content can
  fill niches and attract sufficiently price-inelastic readers who are willing
  to pay for a subscription to those newsletters. Therefore, Substack not only
  depends on the size of its network to generate revenues, but also its
  strength: the more the platform can induce readers to become
  <em>paying subscribers</em>, the higher Substack’s revenue. Available data
  would support this assertion: the recommendations feature, or network aspect
  of Substack, drives 40% of subscriptions on the platform and 20% of paid
  subscriptions. Readers are heavily influenced by Substack’s recommendations
  and writers depend on Substack’s network for a sizable portion of their
  revenues, demonstrating that network size is essential for Substack’s success
  as a publishing service and platform.
</p>
<p>
  In a network business model, platforms often offer introductory pricing,
  allowing the platform to grow its reader and creator network, or its installed
  base. Once the network reaches sufficient size, the base becomes sufficiently
  locked in—users do not leave, as other platforms have less content, and
  creators do not migrate to another platform for fear of slower subscriber
  growth. Thus, the platform is now able to extract more surplus from its users
  and creators, such as through higher prices for access to the network. Beehiiv
  has applied elements of introductory pricing, with prices much lower than its
  better-established, extremely-similar competitor Ghost, that are also flat
  relative to the number of subscribers, giving an extra cost boost for larger
  creators. Substack is building its network through introductory pricing—the
  service grew a lot, for example, by signing well-known writers with followings
  who could induce paying subscribers. Substack has offered sweetheart deals to
  these high-profile creators, giving them an advance on subscription revenues.
  This would help Substack build a large network of creators who will draw in a
  larger network of users; in essence, building an installed base. Creators
  themselves often offer ‘introductory pricing’ to their subscribers by allowing
  them to subscribe for free, with the hope of converting them to paying
  subscribers later on to access gated content. Because Substack does not charge
  writers for free subscribers and only takes revenue from the paying
  subscribers, this is a form of introductory pricing by Substack to writers
  (compared to Ghost and Beehiiv which charge for free subscribers). When
  subscribers convert from free to paying, Substack then collects more of that
  marginal revenue than Ghost or Beehiiv, increasing prices to creators once
  their readers become willing to pay. Allowing the ‘gifting’ of one-month
  subscriptions of certain newsletters by current paying subscribers is also a
  form of introductory pricing on Substack by both the platform and creators to
  readers, which is done in the hope of gaining a paid subscriber. Beehiiv is
  pursuing a different form of introductory pricing. Its “core” newsletter
  platform service costs much less than Ghost and has a constant price until
  200,000 subscribers, which for a large range of subscriber values is less than
  the cost of hosting.
</p>
<p>
  The final step of a network, locking in subscribers, is also increasingly
  becoming a feature of these newsletter platforms. Substack, for example, has
  placed greater emphasis on users reading newsletters through its mobile app,
  instead of email. Technically, this would fall outside our product market of
  interest, because users’ incentives to check apps are different than receiving
  emails, but it has vital implications for Substack’s network strategy. Rather
  than having users check their email for newsletters, where an email from
  Substack is equivalent to one from Beehiiv or Ghost, Substack is pushing for
  readers to access content through Substack’s app, making those newsletter
  readers more exclusive to Substack and effectively ‘locking’ them into the
  network. This approach is debatable, as readers might not check Substack’s app
  as often as their email, but there is also the benefit for a creator of using
  Substack’s popularity as a platform to build their own individual readership.
  However, newsletter readers are likely to check their email regardless,
  meaning that the switching cost of reading through an app is likely higher
  than continuing to use email, and this attempt to lock in readers may be
  unsuccessful. When Substack first released its mobile app, by default it
  paused email notifications for subscribers who installed the app “to prevent
  duplicate notifications.” However, the attempt to lock in readers and writers
  to Substack’s platform encountered criticism and the change was quickly
  reversed, thereby keeping email notifications intact.<br />
  Another way in which Substack is trying to close its platform is the
  introduction of Substack Notes, a platform for Substack writers to publish
  short-form, public content; essentially, an in-house Twitter. This is
  especially notable because Substack, and all of the major newsletter
  platforms, are heavily integrated with Twitter, allowing writers to seamlessly
  promote content through their Twitter accounts. A recent spat with Twitter
  meant that Substack newsletters could no longer be easily promoted on the
  platform; instead, Substack Notes allows writers to engage with their readers,
  and the wider public, in a similar format as on Twitter, but within the
  Substack platform. Other newsletter platforms are still integrated with
  Twitter; moving short-form content to Substack would limit readers’ time to
  engage with the newsletter writers not on Substack, who promote their content
  through Twitter. Thus, readers and writers will be further locked into
  Substack’s network. However, as with the email example, it is unclear that
  Substack’s effort would be successful: Twitter currently has far more readers
  than Substack, and far more prospective subscribers to newsletters than those
  who are actively searching Substack Notes. Substack’s weakened integration
  with Twitter may favor other newsletter platforms instead of locking in their
  base.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  However, Substack is fundamentally unable to lock creators in. Substack, as
  well as all other major newsletter publishing services, allows writers to
  easily migrate their content and email lists (as all payments in this industry
  are handled by creator-owned Stripe accounts, those can be transferred easily
  as well). Thus, Substack has no way to effectively lock creators in. If a
  creator determined that the benefits of being attached to Substack’s network
  were less than Substack’s cost premium over alternatives, they could migrate
  their subscribers to Ghost or Beehiiv, earning equal revenues at a lower fee.
  Readers, meanwhile, would still receive the exact same newsletter. Thus,
  readers are not harmed, and creators lower their costs while losing the
  benefits of the recommendation feature to gain new users. This would indicate
  that Substack has no route to extracting more surplus from current creators,
  as any increased price for users or creators would have to be offset by the
  growth benefits of its recommendation feature.
</p>
<h2><strong>Reader Demand Saturation</strong></h2>
<p>
  Substack’s network dilemma leads us to consider how Substack could raise
  prices without creator flight. The premise of our thesis is that over time,
  reader demand for newsletters will saturate; alternatively, readers have a
  limited capacity to read, and hence, writers will increasingly compete with
  one another for readers’ attention.
</p>
<p>
  To understand the drivers of saturation, we can consider the market for email
  newsletters, specifically Substack writers. Entry barriers in content creation
  are fairly weak—literacy in the U.S. is high and fixed costs are low.
  Moreover, in an unsaturated market, readers are still willing to add
  newsletters that suit their preferences, meaning that the readers ‘acquired’
  by existing newsletters does not preclude an entrant from ‘acquiring’ those
  same readers. The rise of AI-assisted writing, such as with ChatGPT, will also
  enable many more writers’ entry and for each writer to produce more
  newsletters. Individual writers will therefore be able to produce much larger
  quantities of writing at a lower cost of production, thereby ‘flooding the
  market’ of newsletters without falling into unprofitability. Given these low
  entry barriers, and obvious differentiation, the newsletter market would be
  monopolistically competitive, meaning that short-run profits can be earned
  through product differentiation, but copying that differentiation would
  prevent long-run profits. However, this comes with a caveat: part of a
  newsletter’s differentiation is its author’s name and reputation, which cannot
  be easily replicated or replaced by an entrant, providing some avenue for
  existing newsletters to build long-run profits.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  However, this differentiation is only successful insofar as there is demand
  for such variety, or heterogeneous consumer preferences. To a certain extent,
  readers will have exogenous preferences for what they read based on their
  personal interests; these preferences may also exogenously change with varying
  degrees of frequency, depending on that reader’s strength of preferences.
  Horizontally, newsletters can differentiate in both topic and style, and, as a
  result, will attract different sets of readers. From this perspective,
  heterogeneity among readers should not saturate a market: as long as a new
  creator can find a new topic or style niche, which can vary significantly,
  they can earn short-run profits and will thus enter the market. However, there
  are also some limits to this heterogeneity: while writing style and topics can
  vary almost infinitely, the newsletter format more broadly is decidedly
  longer-form. For example, a Beehiiv newsletter is not a close substitute for
  its author’s Twitter feed because the depth of content and frequency with
  which it is delivered differs, which affects the informational value to the
  reader.
</p>
<p>
  There is also an aspect of vertical heterogeneity, concerning willingness to
  pay for newsletter content. Americans’ wealth distribution will imply
  reasonably broad heterogeneity; this willingness to pay will also restrict
  quantity, as Substack requires writers to charge readers at least $5 per month
  for a paid subscription. Thus, readers’ willingness to pay for newsletters
  overall will also be limited by their willingness to pay for each individual
  newsletter: even if someone’s willingness to pay for newsletters overall is a
  total of $100 per month, if they do not value any individual newsletter over
  $3 per month, they will spend a total of $0 instead of $100. This may somewhat
  limit their vertical heterogeneity.
</p>
<p>
  From a time perspective, there is also a very clear upper bound on newsletter
  readership. In terms of reading broadly, Americans read less every year,
  reading for pleasure less than 20 minutes a day in 2021, down from 23 minutes
  per day reading in 2004. This has not been supplanted by reading news:
  estimated newspaper circulation is at its lowest point since at least 1940,
  with 13 million papers lost from 2014 to 2020. Online news readers increased
  by only five million in that same period, suggesting that some eight million
  news readers were lost in those six years and not to reading books or
  magazines. Moreover, the average minutes per news website visit is down 30%
  since 2014, suggesting that Americans are also willing to spend less time
  reading news. Newsletters are unlikely to have filled this gap, with Substack
  having only been founded halfway through this period and, in 2020, having only
  250,000 paying subscribers, implying a total readership between two and six
  million, given that typically, 5-10% of Substack readers pay. There is
  therefore an undeniable decline in reading in America, which not only suggests
  that Americans have a binding reading capacity, but also a decreasing one.
  Thus, readers’ heterogeneity in willingness to pay for newsletters is limited
  by both Substack’s pricing scheme and their time constraint. Some of this
  vertical heterogeneity is expressed by how writers will offer both free and
  paid content — in effect, price discrimination, based on readers’ different
  willingness to pay.
</p>
<p>
  Horizontal heterogeneity means that any prospective newsletter entrant with an
  appealing differentiation can earn short-run profits and will thus enter. To
  do this, new newsletters must seek out a niche to appeal to that heterogeneity
  and not enter into a niche already dominated by other newsletters; it is
  further important to note that more general topics areas appeal to a wider
  range of readers, and thus are ‘taken’ by earlier newsletters, which are
  likely to be larger by having a broader focus that appeals to more readers,
  and more time to acquire subscribers. Hence, new newsletter content will be
  increasingly narrowly-focused with respect to topic or style in order to
  achieve that niche differentiation and profitability. Meanwhile, this
  increasing number of newsletters will compete with a readership with bounded
  vertical heterogeneity, where each additional newsletters increases a reader’s
  likelihood of removing another. Thus, readers will only want to add
  newsletters that appeal to their preferences more so than their existing
  newsletter portfolio, favoring the niche over the generic, or the new over the
  established.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  This trend will be especially tied to recommendations features.
  Recommendations attempt to offer newsletters based on readers’ expressed
  preferences, and is therefore most effective when it offers a newsletter that
  a reader is more likely to subscribe to. Suggesting a larger newsletter with
  broader content is unlikely to ‘beat’ the existing newsletters in a reader’s
  portfolio, especially if that newsletter is older and the reader is likely to
  have seen it. However, suggesting a newer newsletter with a more focused
  topic, if it appeals narrowly to a reader’s specific interests, is more likely
  to prevail in replacing one of their existing newsletters, and is more likely
  to draw a reader’s excitement, which may also entice them into paying. The
  recommendations feature, therefore, will be more likely to promote niche
  content over more general, established newsletters. Currently, the smaller
  number of newsletters means that readers have less of an idea of what content
  is available and how much content they have capacity for. Thus, they are more
  willing to add, rather than replace, newsletters, so general newsletters with
  large readerships are not threatened by recommendations features promoting
  newer content, and fewer new newsletters exist to be recommended at all.
  However, the maturation of the newsletter industry will give readers more
  information about how much content they can handle in the long run, meaning
  that recommendations will increasingly focus on newer, niche newsletters
  targeted at beating a reader’s existing newsletter portfolio, further favoring
  newer newsletters over larger, established ones.
</p>
<h2><strong>Increased Substitutability &amp; Flight</strong></h2>
<p>
  The aforementioned dynamic speaks to a growing tension between large and small
  creators, defined by number of subscribers. Currently, readership on Substack
  is growing; the recommendation feature drives much of this growth. Because
  other writers choose the newsletters to promote to their subscribers, creators
  are complements to other creators. The more other writers on Substack promote
  a writer’s newsletter, the more subscriptions and revenues the writer earns.
  In this non-saturated market, readers also view newsletters as complements,
  rather than substitutes, as they are willing to add more newsletters without
  replacing them. With the newsletter market still in a growth stage,
  subscribers have not reached their reading capacity for newsletters, meaning
  the market is not saturated. Thus, readers are unlikely to substitute one
  newsletter for another. Furthermore, the newsletter market has a lot of
  differentiated content (recipes, political commentary, short stories, etc.)
  and, currently, not many newsletters, meaning that readers do not view most
  newsletters as close substitutes, increasing reader willingness to add other
  newsletters they view as unique.
</p>
<p>
  However, because the newsletter market is monopolistically competitive, more
  and more newsletters will enter with more and more niche differentiations;
  then, readers will increasingly meet their capacities and become less willing
  to add new newsletters, unless an option is more appealing than the portfolio
  of newsletters they have already settled with. And while the number of free
  newsletters a reader is subscribed to is not as binding a ceiling as paid
  newsletters because readers can skim or ignore some newsletters, the money
  spent on paid newsletters creates a binding constraint, making paid newsletter
  subscriptions more substitutes than complements to readers. The
  recommendations feature becomes relevant here: given the reasoning discussed
  above, recommendations will promote newsletters to readers that are
  increasingly niche and newer, thereby promoting smaller creators more than
  large ones.
</p>
<p>
  The issue of reputation also speaks to this tension: large creators who
  migrated their followings to Substack lent the platform credibility, which new
  and small creators become able to take advantage of with no additional benefit
  to the large creators. Substack’s pricing model also creates a divide between
  large and small creators. For small creators, a take-rate-based payment for
  Substack’s services is favorable: rather than paying for newsletter services
  upfront, and hoping that subscriber revenues will exceed that fixed cost,
  writers can generate revenue first and pay a portion of that to Substack
  later. This method is also likely cheaper for those creators who have a small
  subscriber base: an upfront fee usually exceeds expected revenues, preventing
  writer entry. Large creators, on the other hand, would pay less under Ghost
  and Beehiiv’s fixed fee model than the 10% take rate. Because Substack’s
  higher price to creators is justified by its network through its
  recommendations feature, large creators will therefore get less value out of
  Substack’s unique feature than they pay for, while the opposite is true for
  the smaller and newer creators. Thus, large newsletters will have an incentive
  to move to a cheaper platform without a strong recommendations feature in
  order to maximize their value.
</p>
<h2><strong>Substack’s Future</strong></h2>
<p>
  As all large platforms allow hassle-free platform migration through exportable
  email lists and creator-owned Stripe accounts for paid subscriptions, large
  creators will migrate off of Substack.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Locking in large creators and extracting surplus from them could be a
  profitable approach for Substack. As discussed, Substack is already attempting
  to lock creators into its network with the introduction of Notes and mobile
  app, albeit with limited success. Substack could seek to build on this lock-in
  by offering Substack as a subscription to readers on the app, and distributing
  that extracted surplus to writers. However, this would essentially subject
  writers to the same model under which they were employed by newspapers and
  magazines, making this approach unlikely.
</p>
<p>
  Moreover, Substack has made no attempts to block the ease of migration for
  creators, thereby limiting the degree to which those creators are locked into
  the platform. Any attempt to foreclose on creator exit by blocking migration
  would likely result in legal action related to Substack’s Terms of Service,
  which state that creators own the list of their readers’ emails; payment lists
  in Stripe are not managed by Substack and Substack is thus unable to foreclose
  on payment services either. Substack’s failed attempt to remove email
  newsletters for app users, met with writer backlash, suggests that similar
  attempts at foreclosure would fail. Moreover, forcing large creators to remain
  on a platform that charges a premium for a harmful differentiation, will
  discourage prospective writers from entry, realizing that they are doomed to
  have diminished long-run profits, reducing Substack’s future network size and
  thus its value to readers and new writers looking to Substack’s network to
  grow their readership.
</p>
<p>
  Another course of action for Substack, which we argue is more realistic, is
  that Substack will allow the exit of its largest creators and instead use its
  network to service smaller, newer, more niche creators seeking a platform to
  act as an incubator and help them to ‘break out’ and ‘graduate’ from Substack
  once their subscriber base becomes stable. Readers of large newsletters can
  remain subscribed to that content, but their Substack accounts will remain and
  offer them a way to search for new content through recommendations. In this
  scenario, Substack has sunk the most investments of any platform into building
  a network; these sunk costs create an entry barrier that would prevent other
  platforms from attempting to compete with Substack as a network-based
  newsletter platform. Moreover, concentration on one platform may be
  welfare-enhancing: readers gain the most utility from a platform with the most
  writers and vice versa, such that one platform with all readers and writers
  delivers more total utility than two platforms segregating the reader and
  writer bases. Already, we can see that Beehiiv’s attempt to build a network
  has been met with limited success, though it is still a relatively new
  feature. This could be attributed to Beehiiv’s need to spend on significant
  network investment costs: Substack has already sunk the cost of attracting
  readers to its writer network and bringing writers to its platform, while
  Beehiiv would need to spend significantly to woo writers away from Substack to
  then build a reader base. This entry failure of a firm which already has some
  cost advantages over other potential entrants, as Beehiiv has newsletter
  publishing technology and expertise, suggests that the network-based
  newsletter platform market will be either a very small oligopoly (by number of
  firms) or a Substack monopoly.
</p>
<p>
  In a monopoly, Substack would clearly earn positive long-run profits,
  incentivizing it to keep this ‘incubator’ business model. In the oligopoly
  case, Substack has a key form of product differentiation that will enable it
  to earn positive long-run profits in this sub-industry with entry barriers:
  network size. Substack already has 20 million readers on its platform whose
  emails will remain even when large creators leave. Thus, new writers will be
  attracted to Substack over other network-based newsletter platforms for
  Substack’s larger base of readers, or potential subscribers. Even if Substack
  does not gain a monopoly in network-based newsletter platforms, its large and
  sticky network will provide it a form of product differentiation to creators
  that would allow it to differentiate and escape Bertrand’s paradox in an
  oligopoly. Network size would presumably always be favored by new writers,
  such that Substack’s differentiation would remain popular and it could still
  earn positive long-run profits with an incubator business model.
</p>
<p>
  The newsletter publishing services that large creators ‘graduate’ into will be
  a dissimilar market. Without the network element, there are no clear entry
  barriers: the sunk costs of current newsletter services like Ghost and Beehiiv
  are small, as these platforms bundle services that are mostly outsourced, such
  that they do not incur high fixed costs themselves. Thus, without significant
  entry barriers, the market for non-network newsletter services will be
  competitive. However, there is obviously differentiation in this market: for
  example, Revue offered a cheaper service with less customization features,
  while Ghost offers a more expensive service for more customization that
  especially appeals to technology-savvy writers. Hence, the market for
  newsletter services targeted at mature creators would be monopolistically
  competitive, with new entrants seeking short-run profits wrought by
  differentiation, yielding no long-term economic profits. This would create a
  bifurcated market for newsletters and their publishing platforms: one side
  catering to up-and-coming newsletters with network-based services and higher
  prices, while the other would cater to more mature creators and offer less of
  a network in exchange for lower prices.
</p>
<h2><strong>Social Welfare</strong></h2>
<p>
  The bifurcation of the newsletter publishing platform market and the removal
  of gatekeepers in the form of newspapers and book publishers means that the
  best writers of a generation will have a higher chance of succeeding as
  writers than in the past. While writers would previously have had to work
  through a newspaper’s bureaucracy or another notable career to succeed as an
  independent writer, talented creators can now seek recognition directly
  through newsletter publishing platforms, lowering these reputation-based
  barriers to entry for writers. As a result, readers will benefit from
  increased entry of talented writers, improving the quality of the content they
  consume.
</p>
<p>
  Newsletter publishing platforms make consumers better off because consumers
  choose a bundle that they enjoy the most, an a-la-carte bundle. An a-la-carte
  selection provides creators with an accurate signal of the market value of
  their newsletter, as paid subscriptions indicate market interest. Under
  newspapers, all the content was bundled, and newspapers often subsidized less
  popular content, and content supply did not accurately reflect reader demand.
</p>
<p>
  Consumers now pay for a lot of subscriptions for all areas of life. In the
  past, most consumers had a limit to how much they were willing to pay for a
  newspaper, perhaps for one local newspaper and one or two national newspapers,
  and all of their news was bundled. Now, newsletter platforms promote
  subscriptions for each topic a reader demands. A similar bundle of newspaper
  content would cost readers much more on a newsletter service, as high-quality
  content is paywalled individually. Hence, there is a possibility that
  newsletters will end up extracting more surplus out of consumers than
  newspapers. That tension could result in a re-bundling of newspaper-like
  content on newsletters, like Bari Weiss’ <em>The Free Press</em>. This would
  limit the extent to which creators can extract surplus from readers:
  subscribing to a high-quality bundle is often a better deal than subscribing
  to individual newsletters. New business models, either managed through
  newsletter platforms or individual newsletters, might emerge as a result.
  Overall, while consumer welfare is improved in the short term, the medium-term
  impact of newsletter publishing platforms on consumer welfare is less clear,
  as increased attempts by creators to extract surplus from consumers in a
  saturated market could lead to a degradation of the quality of content
  available to consumers for a price similar to a bundled newspaper.
</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>
  This paper highlights the rise of newsletter publishing platforms which
  directly connect writers to their readers through email, and the importance of
  recommendation features to creators. Currently, the creators compete in a
  positive-sum environment, as with growing reader demand for newsletters,
  readers treat newsletters as complements. However, as the newsletter market
  saturates and readers reach their reading capacity, readers will increasingly
  treat newsletters as substitutes. To increase reader reach, recommendations
  features will increasingly promote newer, more niche newsletters, which will
  lower the value of recommendations to large creators. These creators will then
  leave the expensive network-based Substack for cheaper alternatives like
  Beehiiv or Ghost, enabled by exportability of mailing lists and creator-owned
  payment accounts unique to the newsletter publishing industry. Thereafter,
  Substack will act as an oligopoly or monopoly incubator for up-and-coming
  newsletters due to its large network, while newsletter platforms without a
  large network will cater to established newsletters in a monopolistically
  competitive market.
</p>
<p>
  There are some limitations to our thesis. It is not a given that the
  newsletter market will saturate: prospective writers, seeing the declining
  reading trends in the U.S., may be discouraged from writing at all, preventing
  higher growth on the writer side relative to reader growth. Substack may also
  attempt to lock in their writer base, rather than letting them migrate off of
  the platform, although this is unlikely based on past attempts. Lastly, from a
  welfare standpoint, there may be a possibility of coordination between
  platforms or between newsletter writers and platforms to raise prices.
</p>
<p>
  A fundamental question that underlies this paper is how newsletters and
  written media in general will fare in the age of information abundance and
  shorter attention spans. Writer entry into the newsletter market will cause an
  abundance of written information that will undermine readers’ ability to
  search for newsletters without significant assistance, such as through
  recommendation features which would increase Substack’s power as a platform.
  Consumer apps are moving towards catering to shorter attention spans,
  exemplified by TikTok’s 150 million American users. Newsletters’ need to
  compete with other media for consumer attention may similarly push writers
  towards shorter-form, attention-grabbing content, perhaps aided by
  AI-generated summaries. This decline in quality and length will decrease
  readers’ willingness to pay for written news. Moreover, given an increasing
  supply of newsletters and a decreasing demand for reading overall, newsletters
  are operating in a declining market, limiting the long-term growth and
  viability of newsletters and their platforms.
