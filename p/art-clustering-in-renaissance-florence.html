<h3>Note</h3>
<p>
  This paper presupposes knowledge of three components of external scale
  economies (agglomeration economies) as an urbanization force. The components
  are: labor pooling, access to specialized inputs, and knowledge spillover.
  Labor pooling refers to the co-location of firms and workers lowering the
  volatility for both sides of the market. Having many firms in the same
  industry means workers are less exposed to firm-side shocks. If your employer
  fires you because they are not doing well, you can relatively easily find
  another employer in the same industry. Similarly, co-located firms experience
  less volatility of labor supply, making it cheaper to hire labor in times of
  expansion than without co-location. So workers are insuring the firms and
  firms are insuring the workers. Access to specialized inputs refers to having
  high mean levels of a specialized input, such as capital or a natural
  resource. Knowledge spillovers refers to the sharing of knowledge in informal
  channels facilitated by proximity, such as unexpected conversations in a
  coffee shop or at the bar.
</p>
<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>
  One of the notable characteristics of Renaissance Florence is the flourishing
  of art and architecture, collectively referred to as “art” in this paper due
  to the similarity in their consumption patterns. The Renaissance period is
  commonly cited as starting from around the year 1400 until the 1530s. As has
  been extensively studied, the clustering of art in Florence occurred due to a
  developed patronage system that connected wealthy Florentine guilds and
  families with artists. This paper reimagines a well-known narrative of the
  development of the Florentine art cluster with an urban economics lens. The
  discussion centers on patronage being an important specialized input to art
  that arose in the early 1400s due to changes in the forms of conspicuous
  consumption as the elites migrated from the countryside to the city. Labor
  pooling in the form of a wide distribution of patrons provided insurance for
  artists against patron retaliation, and training of artists as goldsmiths—a
  form of spinoffs—along with patron pressure to differentiate words combined
  with the artistic desire for freedom sustained artistic innovation in
  Florence’s art cluster throughout the 15th century. Social tensions in the
  late 15th century and threat of a foreign invasion in the 16th century
  disturbed agglomeration forces, lowering the intensity of the cluster.
</p>
<p>
  Most stories about the rise of industrial clustering focus on modern cities
  which have large populations. Renaissance Florence is a pre-modern city which
  has lower mobility of goods and people, and low population levels with
  relatively low population density. One reason clustering occurs in large
  cities is because with a large population, there is greater potential for an
  individual to come up with innovation that begets clustering. Similarly, a
  greater level of economic activity makes innovation easier. Renaissance
  Florence provides a study of how agglomeration economies shaped a cluster in a
  pre-modern city.
</p>
<h2><strong>Florence Background: 1300s to Early 1400s</strong></h2>
<p>
  At the beginning of the 15th century, Florence had a population of around
  70,000 people. The largest city in Europe at that time was Paris with a
  population of 280,000 while Milan and Venice both had a population of around
  125,000. By modern standards, 1400 cities were small and not particularly
  urbanized, limiting the potential clustering. The urbanization rate in
  Center-North Italy in 1400 was only 17.6%. At the same time, Italy was a lot
  more urbanized than other European locations. An average European urbanization
  rate in 1300 was 9.5 while urbanization rates in Center-North Italy were
  almost 20 percent with only regions like Flanders, Brabant and Holland having
  urbanization rates similar to Italy. In terms of urban structure, Florence had
  no central business district (CBD) and few if any local public goods (LPGs)
  existed with most of the government’s budget going to defense and interest
  payments on bonds.
</p>
<p>
  Florence was one of the wealthiest cities in Europe around the start of the
  Renaissance. Its banking and wool industries were the main drivers of its
  wealth. The Florentine banking industry started its international expansion by
  collecting papal revenue in England and supporting the papacy in its
  opposition to the heirs of imperial Ghibellinism (aligned with the Holy Roman
  Empire) in the mid-late 13th century. Florentine bankers then served the
  papacy “in the international transfer of funds and exchange banking after its
  move to Avignon in 1305,” with the Alberti family being the most prominent
  banking supporters of the papacy. Integration into the papacy’s network
  allowed Florentine bankers to create an extensive network of European
  connections facilitated by Avignon’s location which ensured low transportation
  costs for the banking industry: “Avignon became a major node in the Florentine
  network… the city had a key position on trade routes extending northward along
  the Rhône valley to central France and the Low Countries, westward to
  Montpellier and Spain, and southward into the western Mediterranean commercial
  system.” The wool industry similarly prospered based on Florence’s
  international connections. High quality wool was imported from Northern
  Europe, especially England, and combined with dyes from the East, minimizing
  transportation costs of the two specialized inputs given Florence’s location
  in center-north Italy. Finished high-quality cloth was then sold to Near
  Eastern and Mediterranean markets. Both of these industries raised Florence’s
  wealth, and as a result made the Florentine florin a widely used European
  reserve currency with Florence becoming the place where rates of exchange for
  the currencies of Europe were fixed. The strength of the economy is summarized
  by the fact that “the revenue of the [Florentine] government in 1400 was
  greater than that of England in the heyday of Elizabeth.”
</p>
<p>
  At the same time as the Florentine economy grew in the late 1300s, Florence
  was involved in many conflicts. Florence waged war against the Avignon papacy
  in the War of the Eight Saints (1375-1378). Then, the Ciompi Revolt happened
  in 1378 in which laborers took control of the government and Florence was
  governed by the Ciompi until 1382. “Beginning in 1389, Gian Galeazzo Visconti
  of Milan expanded his dominion into the Veneto, Piedmont, Emilia and Tuscany.
  During this period Florence, under the leadership of Maso degli Albizzi and
  Niccolò da Uzzano was involved in three wars with Milan (1390–92, 1397–98,
  1400–02)” which ended with Gian Galeazzo’s death from a plague in 1402.
  Florence then incorporated Pisa into its land holdings in 1406, giving
  Florence access to the sea. The beginning of the 15th century marked a decline
  in feudal warfare and a start of a largely uninterrupted peace, opening up the
  doors to the urban forces that eventually resulted in what is now known as
  Renaissance Florence.
</p>
<h2><strong>The Beginnings: Early 1400s</strong></h2>
<p>
  With the rise of peace in the early 1400s, Florence began to focus on its
  internal affairs. While the wars in the late 1300s were still ongoing,
  Florence was undergoing substantial changes. As mentioned before, the
  urbanization rate in Center-North Italy in 1400 was around 17.6% and many
  cities in that region of Italy have been highly urbanized for that time since
  the 1300s. However, the role of the city was constrained by constant warfare
  between the Italian city-states. As historian Richard Goldthwaite explores in
  his article
  <em>The Empire of Things: Consumer Demand in Renaissance Florence</em>, the
  early 1400s embodied the transition from a culture of feudalism which focused
  on rural land to a city-oriented culture. Under traditional feudal
  values—still dominant in most parts of Europe in 1400, especially the
  north—the elites asserted their status through large palaces and villas, a
  military ethos, and land interests. Feudalism called for traditional values
  embodied in the chivalric code. The elites trained in arms and expressed
  hospitality through welcoming guests in their large houses. Goldthwaite
  elaborates: “Consumption was directed to the rounding out of this scenario [of
  hospitality] for the assertion of status. Clothes, plate for the table, and
  retinues of liveried servants, dependents, and clients dominated expenditures…
  For this way of life, <em>conspicuous consumption</em> was a kind of
  investment in the noble’s social position that secured service and paid
  dividends in the universal recognition of his dignity and status” (emphasis
  mine). As coined by Thorstein Veblen, conspicuous consumption involved wealthy
  individuals consuming valuable goods with the primary goal being not the
  utility from the good itself, but the acquisition of status from consuming the
  good.
</p>
<p>
  The relatively high level of urbanization of Italian cities—in contrast to
  northern Europe—resulted in an environment where cities resisted feudal-style
  assertions of status. Goldthwaite notes: “As a sense of public authority
  gradually asserted itself against the amorphous corporatism of the earlier
  commune, the nobility found its room for independent behaviour more
  constricted and its idiosyncratic ways curbed; and it eventually lost what had
  been its unique contribution to the commune with the increasing recourse to
  professional soldiers in the fourteenth century.” Even serving on the
  <em>Signoria</em>, the highest government office in Florence, did not allow
  for displays of status and terms of office were only two months. The lack of
  occasions for hospitality meant that a man’s status was not to be judged by
  the number of his attendants and the scale of his hospitality, and servants
  and a kitchen were not a major part of household expenditure. Goldthwaite
  again: “Feudalism provided the only real secular model for luxury
  expenditures, but it was an expression of values and attitudes that were
  remote from the realities of Renaissance Italy.” In short, wealthy households
  had no traditional way of asserting their status.
</p>
<p>
  In response—as a way of asserting their status—wealthy households became art
  patrons. The wealthy sponsored architectural developments throughout Florence
  and such developments physically embodied their power and wealth. Similar to
  the feudal nobility’s investment in their social status through hosting
  guests, wealthy families’ of Florence conspicuous consumption of patronage
  asserted their status. In other words, the Florentine elite consumed not art,
  but patronage—art’s sponsorship. The rise of the city and the corresponding
  decline in traditional feudal values created a vital specialized input of art
  production—high levels of patronage from wealthy families. Peaceful times
  following decades of war meant that the wealthy could now focus on enhancing
  their status instead of worrying about potential disruptions due to ongoing
  conflict, with Florence’s and Italian urban structure pushing the wealthy to
  become art patrons.
</p>
<p>
  Similar to individual patrons, Florentine guilds also became art sponsors.
  Florentine guilds were divided into seven greater guilds known as
  <em>arti maggiori</em> and fourteen minor trades guilds that were the
  <em>arti minori</em>. The guilds, especially the greater ones which included
  the wool guild, were wealthy as a result of Florence’s strong economy.
  Competition for political influence, with a similar idea of conspicuous
  consumption done by individuals, induced these guilds to commission
  high-quality art works to promote their reputations. As economist Tyler Cowen
  notes, “the commercial guilds exercised their greatest influence on
  large-scale sculpture, a medium that few private individuals could afford.”
  Arguably the most famous competitions occurred in 1401 when the cloth guild,
  the Calimala, commissioned the Baptistery bronze doors and Lorenzo Ghiberti
  got the commission by defeating Filippo Brunelleschi. Goldthwaite notes: “For
  half a century, from the 1401 competition for its second doors almost to the
  time of his death, Ghiberti was employed virtually full time on the two sets
  of doors,” highlighting the scale of funding necessary to support such a large
  project. “At Orsanmichele [church] another ambitious sculptural program got
  underway with the legislation for 1406 instructing the guilds to contribute
  statues of their patron saints for their respective places around the outer
  facades; by 1427 fourteen more life-size figures in stone were completed. The
  richest guilds—the Calimala ([cloth]), the Cambio (bankers), and the Lana
  (wool)—decided, in competition with one another, to pay ten times the cost of
  a marble figure to have their in bronze; so Ghiberti had yet another occasion
  to demonstrate his virtuosity, making the largest figures cast in bronze since
  late antiquity.” Another large commission occurred in 1418 when the wool
  guild—the Lana—announced a competition for the cupola of Florence’s Cathedral
  in which Brunelleschi won the commission over Ghiberti. Work on the dome began
  in 1420 and finished in 1436. Among other notable commissions, the guild of
  the armorers and sword makers commissioned Donatello’s
  <em>St George</em> around 1415 and the linen guild commissioned Fra Angelico
  to paint a Madonna for their guildhall.” Thus, conspicuous consumption as an
  assertion of status was an important force for both individuals and guilds.
  The specialized input of patronage ensured the high availability of funding
  for artists and started the art cluster of Renaissance Florence.
</p>
<h2><strong>The Sustainment: Mid to Late 1400s</strong></h2>
<p>
  While the Florentine art cluster arose from the specialized input of
  patronage, the cluster was sustained through the forces of labor pooling and
  formal training—similar to Steven Klepper’s discussion of spinoffs within the
  contexts of Silicon Valley and Detroit—and contributed towards artistic
  freedom and a market that pushed artists towards innovations in the field of
  art.
</p>
<p>
  Two key components of labor pooling within the context of Renaissance Florence
  include a relatively high degree of social mobility and a wide distribution of
  wealth providing artists with insurance against patron retaliation. If a
  patron stops supporting an artist because the patron lost confidence in the
  artist's potential, that artist can find a different patron as long as the
  artist did not engage in corruption or other undesirable behavior. If, on the
  other hand, the patron stops supporting an artist because of a negative
  economic shock, that artist could relatively find another patron due to the
  nature of Florentine social mobility. Goldthwaite notes: “The
  commercial-banking sector had ups and downs that could dramatically make and
  break fortunes. This sector was oriented to speculation in markets abroad and
  was not at all protected by a state banking system at home holding in the
  reins of money and credit, and men with investments in it were exposed to the
  unlimited liability of the partnership contract underlying business
  organization.” In other words, demand for patronage varied
  idiosyncratically—some families experienced negative economic shocks and
  demanded less patronage while other families were on the rise and engaged in
  more conspicuous consumption, lowering the volatility of artist earnings.
</p>
<p>
  The wide distribution of wealth is best captured by the Florentine Catasto
  (tax assessment) of 1427, made in response to a high level of government debt
  as a result of an ongoing conflict with Milan that was expensive but
  ultimately not existential. “One-quarter of the total wealth of the city was
  in the hands of 100 men (heads of households), and one-half of the liquid
  wealth—commercial and industrial capital and credits—was in the hand of 250 to
  300 men (2.5 to 3 percent of all those filing declarations). At this point,
  most historians end their exploration of the Catasto. However, Goldthwaite
  compares 1427 Florence to 1500 Nuremberg, one of the wealthiest cities north
  of the Alps which was half the size of Florence at the time of the Catasto.
  Comparing the top 100 assessments in both cities, he notes that in Nuremberg,
  37 merchants were assessed from 10,000 to 100,000 Rheingulden (worth at the
  time about one-quarter less than the same amount of florins [i.e. 7,500
  Rheingulden is equivalent to 10,000 florins], and the 63 others fall into a
  bracket ranging from 10,000 down to 1,000 Rheingulden; on the Florentine list
  of the highest 600 assessments, 86 men fall in the top bracket extending
  upward from 10,000 florins to 116,000 florins (not a very different
  distribution from that in Nuremberg, considering the population difference),
  and the second bracket containing all the rest has a cut-off point of about
  1,500 florins. In other words, at the top level of wealth the Nuremberg
  merchants could almost hold their own with the Florentines, but at the next
  level the Florentines outnumbered them well over nine times.”
</p>
<p>
  In addition, historian Gene Bruckner notes that the spatial distribution of
  families was such that wealthy families were not concentrated in any single
  part of Florence. Districts were heterogeneous and no sections of the city
  “were reserved exclusively for the rich, no ghettoes inhabited solely by the
  poor.” The observation makes sense from an urban perspective as Florence had
  no centralization force of a CBD nor amenities in terms of LPGs. “Each
  prominent family was closely identified with a particular neighborhood, where
  the first urban generation had settled—its members banding together for
  protection—in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. By 1400, the danger of
  physical attack from a rival house or faction was less real, but the pressures
  to remain in the ancestral neighborhood were very strong. For in its own
  district, a family could muster the support among relatives, dependents, and
  friends which enhanced its political role in the commune.” Based on the
  Catasto of 1527, when looking at twenty-two richest individuals (those with
  assets greater than 30,000 florins), only three out of sixteen Florentine
  neighborhoods have no representation on the list, six neighborhoods have one
  person on the list, five neighborhoods have two people, and two neighborhoods
  have three of the twenty-two richest individuals, highlighting the lack of
  concentration of wealth (Figure 1). Looking at the list of 137 households with
  at least 10,000 florins of assets, we see that the decentralization of wealth
  around Florence holds beyond the richest households in Florence (Figures 2 and
  3). The wide distribution of wealth both in absolute and spatial terms made
  Florence an attractive place for artists. The high level of wealth provided
  the specialized input that jump-started the Renaissance and wealth’s broad
  distribution ensured the stability of artist funding sources over time.
  Simultaneously, the identification of patrons with a particular neighborhood
  made patronage even more attractive from a social status perspective. People
  of Florence know where prominent families live and that each of them values
  its neighborhood. Sponsoring art in the patron’s own neighborhood becomes the
  ultimate form of conspicuous consumption. Not only can patrons actively brag
  about sponsoring great artists, but people passively learn about the
  sponsorship in the course of their daily lives as they wander around different
  neighborhoods. Florence’s urban structure of patrons distributed across many
  neighborhoods created an environment for intense competition between patrons
  for funding the best art.
</p>
<p>
  The reality of Florence’s art funding stands in stark contrast to other
  European and Italian cities which centralized artist funding in either the
  head of the state or the church. Historian Peter Burke provides the following
  description of what being an artist in other cities looked like: “Permanent
  service at court gave the artist a relatively high status, without the social
  taint of shop-keeping. It also meant relative economic security: board and
  lodging and presents of clothes, money and land. When the prince died,
  however, the artist might lose everything. When the duke of Florence,
  Alessandro de’Medici, was murdered in 1537, Giorgio Vasari, who had been in
  the duke’s service, found his hopes ‘blown away by a puff of wind’ [and
  Florence by 1537 was a court-dominated art city]. Another disadvantage of the
  system was its servitude. At the court of Mantua, Mantegna had to ask
  permission to travel or to accept outside commissions. It was not possible to
  avoid the demands of patrons as easily as those of temporary clients.” “An
  impression remains that court artists were more likely than others to have to
  dissipate their energies on the transient and the trivial.” “When an artist
  kept a shop, on the other hand, he had less economic security and a lower
  social status, but it was easier for him to evade a commission that he did not
  want, as Giovanni Bellini seems to have done in the case of a request from
  Isabella d’Este [of Mantua, a prominent patron of the Renaissance].”&nbsp;
  While permanent service provided artists with security, it made artists
  dependent on the will of the patron and fluctuations in patron economic status
  directly affected the artist whether through less funding for their work or a
  complete loss of their job. Naples, Milan, Ferrara, and Mantua centralized
  artistic commissions in the hands of the state. “Milan was much larger than
  Florence and possessed more military power, but its arts did not benefit
  accordingly. Milan did not have a comparably diversified background in
  commercial crafts [to be discussed in the formal training section]. Milanese
  culture was based around a princely court, especially during the reign of the
  Sforza family [1450-1535].” Venice was the most similar city to Florence in
  its financing of art due to its wealth which came from its trade ties with
  Orient, and the similar status of its ducat to the florin as a European
  reserve currency. However, Venice specialized in glasswork and mosaic, thereby
  not competing directly with Florence in architecture. There was some
  competition between Florence and Venice in painting, but that occurred closer
  to the end of the 15th century. In short, no Italian city offered the same
  high level of funding for art distributed across many patrons as Florence.
</p>
<p>
  Another strong force for sustaining Florence’s dominance in the art world was
  its strong culture of formal training. Most successful artists went through an
  apprenticeship with another successful artist, a form of spinoffs that sustain
  the art clustering. Most of the Florentine artists were trained in
  goldsmithing. As Cowen explains: “Goldsmiths worked with a variety of forms,
  including gold, silver, bronze, marble, wood, clay, and textiles. Many of the
  objects made by goldsmiths, such as shrines and reliquaries, took on
  architectural forms and required drawing and design ability. Goldsmiths also
  acquired expertise in casting metals, setting jewels, and engraving. Sometimes
  goldsmiths were required to paint inlays on the pieces they set. They also
  studied the use of color and had a strong working knowledge of geometry. These
  skills accounted for the versatility of the Renaissance artist. Cowen adds:
  “The goldsmith and metal-working trades, prominent in Florence, supported and
  trained many artistic talents of the Italian Renaissance. In the Renaissance,
  Florentine wealth led to a favorable balance of payments on the gold florin
  and a continual inflow of gold. Goldsmithing activity was prevalent, and by
  the middle of the fourteenth century, forty-four goldsmiths’ shops lined the
  Ponte Vecchio… Many Florentine artists started out as goldsmiths or studied
  with goldsmiths to acquire the necessary technical skills. The list includes
  Orcagna, Andrea Pisano, Ghiberti, Brunelleschi, Donatello, Michelozzo, Luca
  della Robbia, Cellini, Antonio Pollaiuolo, Verrocchio (Donatello’s student),
  Leonardo (Verrocchio’s student), Ghirlandaio (Michelangelo’s teacher),
  Botticelli Andrea del Sarto, and Vasari. If we include those who studied with
  a goldsmith (Michelangelo) or whose father was a goldsmith (Raphael), we
  nearly exhaust the roster of prominent Florentine artists” (additional details
  about student status added in parentheses). Formal training of artists
  contributed to the cultivation of local talent. “Thriving markets for small
  artistic commissions and crafts were essential for training and supporting
  budding artists.” “For painters and sculptors, the fundamental unit was the
  workshop, the <em>bottega</em> - a small group of men producing a wide variety
  of objects in collaboration and a great contrast to the specialist,
  individualist artist of modern times.” This discussion points to the dominant
  role of the cultivation of domestic talent in Florence over the importation of
  talent from other Italian regions and from abroad as the dominant way in which
  Florentine artists rose to prominence. It also points to the difference
  between art and architecture within the context of Renaissance Florence. While
  architecture was primarily funded by patrons at first because of its degree of
  public display and magnificence, the broad training of artists meant that
  artists also ventured into art, but because of the smaller magnitude of an
  individual art piece, they are less historically discussed. In a study of six
  hundred painters, sculptors, architects, humanists, writers, ‘composers’ and
  ‘scientists,’ historian Peter Burke finds that 26 percent of the art elite
  came from Tuscany (where Florence is located) with its 10 percent share of the
  population. We can see that Tuscany is overrepresented in elite artists
  compared to its population. The value of visual arts is also apparent: 60
  percent of Burke’s Tuscany sample went into the arts (95 visual artists to 62
  non-visual artists).
</p>
<p>
  While each of the previously discussed components of the Florentine arts
  cluster is important individually, their combination produced a magical
  outcome. High levels and wide distribution of wealth created an environment
  where artists could cluster in one location and not be dependent on a single
  patron for their livelihood. Competition between patrons in the creation of
  new architectural objects resulted in innovation in architectural methods. As
  Goldthwaite notes, “zeal for building sometimes inspires new ideas about
  architecture, especially when new buildings are being put up to establish the
  public presence of important men and institutions, whether merchants and
  monastic orders in Florence or banks and corporations in New York City, rather
  than to satisfy mere functional needs. When this is the spirit in which
  building is initiated, any innovation in style is likely to generate its own
  demand. Modernization for its own sake thus becomes a factor in the complex
  formula explaining the forces that converge in the marketplace to get new
  buildings built.” Artists had more freedom to experiment because of the
  decentralized nature of financing and, especially within paintings, less
  cultural church oversight during the Western Schism and the special
  relationship the papacy had with Florentine bankers. Unlike other Italian
  cities, the economic and urban structure of Florence encouraged innovation
  within the arts. Florence’s urban structure created a self-fulfilling flywheel
  of art creation unlike anything else in the world of Renaissance Florence.
</p>
<p>
  Burke notes that a “characteristic generally ascribed to the culture of
  Renaissance Italy, and discussed in detail in Burckhardt’s famous book on the
  subject, is ‘individualism.’ Like ‘realism’, ‘individualism’ is a term which
  has come to bear too many meanings. It will be used here to refer to the fact
  that works of art in this period (unlike the Middle Ages) were made in a
  personal style… The testimony of contemporary artists suggests that, in the
  fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, artists and public alike were interested in
  individual styles. In his craftsman’s handbook, Cennino Cennini advised
  painters ‘to find a good style which is right for you’. In his discussion of
  the perfect courtier and his understanding of the arts, Baldassare Castiglione
  suggested that Mantegna, Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo and Giorgione were
  each perfect ‘in his own style’... There was, of course, much imitation of
  classical and modern artists and writers. Indeed, it was probably the norm.
  The point about individualism, like secularism, is not that it was dominant,
  but that it was relatively new, and that it distinguishes the Renaissance from
  the Middle Ages.” At the end of the <em>Patrons and Clients</em> chapter,
  Burke concludes that Florence’s market “may well have encouraged the
  increasing differentiation of subject matter and individualism of style noted
  in the first chapter: the exploitation of the artist’s unique qualities in
  order to catch the eye of a purchaser.” Florence’s urban structure pushed
  artists to create art that differed from art produced in other locations.
  Florence’s cluster produced a unique type of art at the time of its
  flourishing.
</p>
<p>
  Another insight into the Florentine cluster comes from the venture capitalist
  Paul Graham who notes: “It's in fields like the arts or writing or technology
  that the larger environment matters. In these the best practitioners aren't
  conveniently collected in a few top university departments and research labs —
  partly because talent is harder to judge, and partly because people pay for
  these things, so one doesn't need to rely on teaching or research funding to
  support oneself. It's in these more chaotic fields that it helps most to be in
  a great city: you need the encouragement of feeling that people around you
  care about the kind of work you do, and since you have to find peers for
  yourself, you need the much larger intake mechanism of a great city.” While
  Graham focused on the perspective of the artist, we can apply his insight to
  identification of artists in Renaissance Florence. An artist with a similar
  potential to Leonardo da Vinci could have been born in Milan in 1452. However,
  the Sforza family might not have misjudged the artist’s talent and refused to
  fund them. Theoretically, the artist could have moved to Florence and become
  an apprentice, but the artist is not part of the Florentine network and is
  unsure whether they’ll be able to find a job. The artist’s family and friends
  are all located in Milan and the prospect of moving to a new city without any
  network or support would be an incredibly high risk endeavor. Risk taking
  outside of an established cluster has high costs. In Florence, on the other
  hand, all the patrons would be competing for sponsoring the up-and-coming
  artists. Even if the most famous patrons of that time, the Medici family,
  refused to sponsor that artist, other patrons would be on the lookout for them
  and given signals of the artist’s inclination towards greatness, would become
  their sponsor and gain status in the process as the discoverers of great
  talent. Florence’s urban structure helped great artists get discovered as
  every patron competed in the arena of maximizing their prestige by sponsoring
  great art. The Florentine cluster, dictated by its urban structure, developed
  up-and-coming native-born artists who then produced art of a distinct kind.
</p>
<h2><strong>The Decline: Late 1400s to Early 1500s</strong></h2>
<p>
  The Florentine cluster began its decline towards the late 1400s. The event
  that truly marked the decline was the rise of Girolamo Savonarola, a preacher
  who seized power in 1494 and imposed restrictions on art, literature, thought
  and behavior. In other words, Savoranola restricted conspicuous consumption.
  Seeing how much the wealthy spend on patronage, “Savonarola scolded these
  builders because he could not get them to give 10 florins to the poor, whereas
  if he asked them to pay 100 florins for a chapel in San Marco they would do it
  just to display their family arms.” Savoranola was executed in 1498 and
  art-friendly rules in the face of the Medicis came back to power, but that
  display disrupted the art cluster.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Around the same time, Pisa took advantage of the French invasion and declared
  its independence in 1494. In 1497, Florence embarked on a war with Pisa, but
  the endeavour failed miserably, and this led to food shortages. The Florentine
  Republic was in decline. The state of the city that was unfriendly towards
  patronage and had a food shortage decreased the value of specialized inputs
  and labor pooling. By that time, Venice moved towards a market system for art
  and was competing with Florence in the realm of painting, lowering the
  strength of Florence’s art cluster. Some of the most prominent artists who
  were at least trained—if not raised—in Florence, such as Leonardo,
  Michelangelo, and Raphael, went to work in Rome for the papacy as both Julius
  II (1503-1513) and Leo X (1513-1521) sought to increase the papacy’s prestige
  by spending money on expensive art commissions.

<p>
  Florence was under siege for 10 months in 1529-1530 by the Spanish. “Threat of
  Spanish rule centralized Medici authority” and “political centralization (in
  1531) brought true Medici dominance over Florentine art. By mid-century Cosimo
  I ruled Florence with an iron hand and centralized the finance of Florentine
  art in his office” “Cosimo I did not stop at funding his own projects but also
  restricted competing sources of patronage from friars, guilds,
  confraternities, and families. Rights of private patronage over chapels were
  canceled and artistic commissions were now subject to central regulation.” The
  centralization of patronage ultimately nullified all the benefits of access to
  the specialized input of patronage with its wide distribution, destroying the
  Florentine arts cluster.
</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>
  Florence’s background in banking and wool created one of the richest economies
  in Europe in the late 13th century and early 14th century. The decline in
  traditional feudalist values displayed in rural areas and the switch towards a
  city-based method of asserting status resulted in wealthy families turning
  towards patronage as a form of conspicuous consumption. Rich guilds engaged in
  similar forms of conspicuous consumption. The very high level of Florentine
  wealth along with its broad neighborhood distribution meant that patrons
  competed intensely in sponsoring great art and artists were insured against
  retaliation from an individual patron. Artists were formally trained in
  goldsmithing and acquired a diverse array of skills. Florence’s type of
  patronage—a result of its urban structure—pushed artists towards innovations
  in the arts as both artists exercised their artistic freedom and patrons
  pushed artists towards innovation as a way to solidify their status.
</p>
<p>
  As a pre-modern city, Florence had no centralizing forces beyond its jobs. By
  modern standards, Florence would be a small city. In spite of that,
  urbanization forces of agglomeration economies practically indistinguishable
  from the modern day created and sustained Florence’s art cluster. Florence
  created an environment where up-and-coming artists were discovered by patrons
  and trained by successful artists in formal apprenticeships. The Florentine
  art cluster encouraged and rewarded patrons for finding talented artists,
  giving them bragging rights and increasing their social status. The lack of
  competition for artists from other city-states made Florence’s cluster easier
  to sustain and Florence’s urban structure ensured both the discovery of new
  artistic talent and their continual involvement in the Florentine art cluster.
  The decline of public support for the arts, embodied in the ruling years of
  Savonarola disrupted the cluster with some of the best of Florence’s artists
  soon moving to Rome to work for the Pope. A looming war with Spain resulted in
  a centralization of power in the hands of Cosimo I de' Medici which put an end
  to Renaissance Florence through the destruction of the specialized input of a
  large amount of funding and the labor pooling benefits of insuring artists
  against retaliation by an individual patron.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, Florentine art represented a radical departure from traditional art
  of that time. Ideas expressed by Florentine artists showed individuality and
  expressed creativity. Florence’s urban structure encouraged experimentation in
  the arts and experimentation is what gets recorded in human history, for
  history that is a continuation of the status quo loses in prominence to
  innovation. Florence’s urban structure produced artistic flourishing and its
  art entered humanity’s historical record.
