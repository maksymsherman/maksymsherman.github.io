<h1>7 Powers vs. Blockchain</h1>
<h5>February 23rd, 2023</h5>

<p>
  Hamilton Helmer’s
  <a href="https://7powers.com/">7 Powers</a> provides a framework for how to
  think about persistent sources of competitive advantage.
</p>
<p>
  It is easy to take the framework and adapt it to the blockchain context
  without questions, but it’s valuable to examine the validity of each power.
</p>
<p>
  Blockchain businesses' sources of competitive advantage differ from
  non-blockchain businesses.
</p>
<div><hr /></div>
<h3>Power 1: Scale Economies.</h3>
<p>
  A business in which per unit cost declines as production volume increases.
</p>
<h3>In crypto:</h3>
<p>
  Blockchains have diseconomies of scale. Blockchains have limited throughput,
  so increasing blockspace utilization increases transaction costs.
</p>
<p>
  Scaling solutions attempt to tackle diseconomies of scale inherent to
  blockchains by increasing blockchain throughput, but the scale effect is still
  sub-linear.
</p>
<p>
  Concentrated liquidity creates economies of scale. Uniswap pools execute
  transactions at a better price with increased liquidity.
</p>
<h3>Power 2: Network Economies.</h3>
<p>
  The value of a service to each user is enhanced as new users join the network.
</p>
<h3>In crypto:</h3>
<p>Network effects require lock-ins.</p>
<p>
  Blockchains don’t have explicit lock-ins as data is user-owned, but implicit
  lock-ins are abundant.
</p>
<p>Most users still use MetaMask and OpenSea as default options.</p>
<p>
  Typically, network economies require creating a network that is hard to
  replicate. For instance, replicating Uber’s or Lyft’s network of riders and
  drivers would cost tens of billions of dollars.
</p>
<p>
  Many blockchain projects have released tokens to attain network economies. But
  tokenomics-fueled bootstrapping threatens the endurance of network effects.
</p>
<p>
  The fact your competitors can bootstrap a network with tokens (e.g.
  <a

    >Blur</a
  >,

    >SushiSwap vs. Uniswap</a
  >, and
  <a
    href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/vampire-attack-looksrare-vs-opensea?ref=maksymsherman.com"
    >LooksRare vs. OpenSea</a
  >) threatens the endurance of network effects.
</p>
<p>
  Because insurgents have a path to scaling their network with tokens, network
  economies are, to a large extent, a non-enduring power.
</p>
<h3>Power 3: Counter Positioning</h3>
<p>
  A newcomer adopts a new, superior business model which the incumbent does not
  mimic due to anticipated damage to their existing business.
</p>
<h3>In crypto:</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.maksymsherman.com/beyond-blockchain-marketplaces/"
    >Lower take rates of marketplaces</a
  >
  like Blur and Zora are an example of counter-positioning.
</p>
<p>
  Lower take rates are also a
  <a
    href="https://twitter.com/divine_economy/status/1463594141724680193?ref=maksymsherman.com"
    >premise of web3 as a whole</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Ownership of your assets and data also counts as counter-positioning and is
  something non-crypto businesses cannot credibly replicate.
</p>
<h3>Power 4: Switching Costs</h3>
<p>
  The value loss expected by a customer that would be incurred from switching to
  an alternative supplier for additional purchases.
</p>
<h3>In crypto:</h3>
<p>In theory, there should be none as data is open.</p>
<p>In practice, user convenience plays a decisive role.</p>
<p>
  MetaMask is still a dominant wallet because switching wallets is hard and
  scary.
</p>
<h3>Power 5: Branding</h3>
<p>
  The durable attribution of higher value to an objectively identical offering
  that arises from historic info about the seller.
</p>
<h3>In crypto:</h3>
<p>
  Yuga Labs NFTs are one example of
  <a
    href="https://twitter.com/thedefiedge/status/1613540914986901505?s=20&amp;ref=maksymsherman.com"
    >successful branding</a
  >.
</p>
<p>OpenSea still has branding with “normies” and is synonymous with NFTs.</p>
<p>The value of branding should be high in crypto.</p>
<p>
  Projects with access to identical data and similar capabilities will need to
  differentiate themselves through branding.
</p>
<h3>Power 6: Cornered Resource</h3>
<p>
  Preferential access at attractive terms to a coveted asset that can
  independently enhance value.
</p>
<h3>In crypto:</h3>

    >said it</a
  >
  best: “by definition, a blockchain that is designed correctly cannot benefit
  from any kind of cornered resource. The very notion that a blockchain is
  decentralized means that there exists no small group of people that has
  unilateral control or outsized power over it.”
</p>
<p>
  A limited applicability of cornered resources is blockspace. Those with
  preferential access to blockspace can extract more

    >miner extractable value (MEV)</a
  >
  or protect themselves against MEV.
</p>
<p>
  Being a validator and engaging in MEV within your blocks is a cornered
  resource.
</p>
<h3>Power 7: Process Power</h3>
<p>
  Embedded company organization and activity sets which enable lower costs
  and/or superior product.
</p>
<h3>In crypto:</h3>
<p>
  Composable data makes coordination easy compared to non-crypto products. But
  open data does not provide a single actor with a persistent advantage.
</p>
<p>A DAO could develop process power.</p>
<p>
  Process power is currently a limited source of competitive advantage in
  blockchain projects.
</p>
<div><hr /></div>
<p>
  To evaluate blockchain projects, you need to understand persistent advantages
  available to blockchain businesses.
</p>
<p>
  Evaluating the applicability of non-blockchain analogies is an essential step
  in that process.
